think!  it's the scsi card doing the dma transfers not the disks...  the scsi card can do dma transfers containing data from any of the scsi devices it is attached when it wants to.  an important feature of scsi is the ability to detach a device. this frees the scsi bus for other devices. this is typically used in a multi-tasking os to start transfers on several devices. while each device is seeking the data the bus is free for other commands and data transfers. when the devices are ready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data.  on an ide bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked the data and transfered it. this is typically a 10-20ms second lock out for other processes wanting the bus irrespective of transfer time.,3,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

"930418  do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law. [honestly.] the word of sin is restriction. [would i kid you?]   does one man's words encompass the majestic vision of thousands of individuals?  quoting a man is not the same as quoting the order.  taken out of context, words can be interpreted much differently than had one applied them within the confines of their original expression.  i think this is the case regarding hymenaeus beta, frater superior  of the order to which i belong.  when he included that bit from merlinus x' he did us all a service.  he showed us the extremes to which order members have been known to go in their fervor. i have little knowledge regarding reuss' background, but surely he was an unusual man, and he was an important force in the order  for many years.  yet as people change so do orders change, and while we look back so carefully at the dirty laundry of o.t.o. remember that this is only the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed which extend beyond any one individual.  i hope to show that there was and is much room for a difference of opinion within the order itself, perhaps by testing the limits myself.   let us examine this issue a bit more closely....  ""in 1895, karl kellner (1850-1905), a wealthy austrian industrialist and paper chemist, as well as a high-grade mason, founded the ordo templi orientis.  kellner had traveled widely in the east, where he met three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices.   kellner's efforts to develop the order were later assisted by franz hartmann, heinrich klein and theodore reuss, who had worked together prior to joining the o.t.o.  the order was first proclaimed in 1902 in reuss's masonic publication, 'oriflamme'.  on kellner's death, reuss succeeded him as outer head [o.h.o.].  the 'jubilee' edition of the 'oriflamme', published in 1912, announced that the order taught secret of sexual magic.   ""theodore reuss was an interesting character.  born june 28, 1855 in augsburg, he entered masonry in 1876.  he was a singer, journalist and possibly a spy for the prussian political police, infiltrating the socialist league founded by karl marx's daughter and her husband.  reuss was later associated with william wynn westcott, a leader of the golden dawn, who later introduced him to john yarker.  yarker chartered reuss to found the rites of memphis and mizraim in germany.  after several attempts to concretize various masonic rites, reuss settled on the development of the o.t.o.  ""the order experienced reasonably steady growth under reuss' leadership. for example, he chartered papus in france, rudolph steiner in berlin and h. spencer lewis in the usa.  in 1912, the historic meeting between reuss and crowley occurred.  crowley wrote that reuss came to him and accused him of revealing order secrets.  when crowley looked at it afresh, the initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for the first time.  reuss appointed crowley as supreme and holy king of all the english speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked when publishing the material of the equinox.  ""reuss resigned as outer head of the order in 1922 after suffering a stroke and named crowley his successor.  all was well until 1925 when _the book of the law_ was translated into german.  there was a break in the continuity of the order.  manyk members split with the new o.h.o. over the book, which crowley was actively promulgating through the order. he had earlier revise dthe order rituals at reuss's request, deeply infusing the doctrines of the new aeon revelation.""  _an introduction to the history of the o.t.o._, by ad veritatem ix'  within _equinox iii:10_, edited by    hymenaeus beta, frater superior, rex summus sanctissimus,     caliph of the united states of america,       published by samuel weiser, 1990.    there are many possible reasons that our frater superior included this material in _equinox iii:10_.  and this is the real point, is it not? why did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own organization?  does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle of thelema?  or is he exercising his true will and putting forth very complex pictures with no easy answers?  a picture which leaves room for very many interpretations.  it is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of o.t.o. derived out of the dribble of faltering masonry, purchased by clever hucksters with an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them.  and i can take that all the way down to our present caliph, whose feeble support of the 'law of thelema' is laughable at best.  would i be thrown out of the order for speaking in this way?   will i?   i think not. why?  because my frater will see it as a perspective, an interjection i am using as an example.  my illustration shows that we may express things in the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be quite difficult to apprehend at first.  so it may be with oto and merlinus x'.  please look o.t.o. more carefully. i do not support reuss's words myself, as i am not qualified to assess them, and i am critical of their pomposity.  if i who am a member of the order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, then what can this say about the health of the order?  does it mean that the order has 'gone soft' and abandoned its moral principles?  or does it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of universal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmatic requirement?  how shall we resolve these two possibilities?   i find a high calibre of individual associated with ordo templi orientis. they are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane or usual information.  they are quite often artists and geniuses.   having met some 20 longstanding members in the sf bay area (many who are or were very heavily involved with the order), i can vouch for the integrity of the organization as it stands.  i have sometimes questioned the policy of hymenaeus beta.  in these moments  i followed my intuition, and i've found little to stop me from requesting a second initiation from a different o.t.o. body.  i'm happily participating in social groups (feasts or initiations) and have come to know the gnostic mass well enough for my tastes.    this doesn't make me an authority on order politics and explanations, however. i can only hypothesize and relay to you what i understand based on my limited contact with other members.  i urge you not to take the words of merlinus x too far.  there are many ways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved with the order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom and the preservation of individual vision.  i welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response to other posts in this thread.   invoke me under my stars.  love is the law, love under will.  i am i!",19,talk.religion.misc

"the supreme court seems to disagree with you -- they have stated that ""the people"" is a term of art refering to an individual right, and have explicitly mentioned the second amendment as an example.  i quote:    ""... 'the people' seems to have been a term of art employed in   select parts of the constitution.  the preamble declares that the   constitution is ordained, and established by 'the people of the   the u.s.'  the second amendment protects the right of the people   to keep and bear arms ...."" 	- supreme court of the u.s.,  u.s. v. uerdugo-uriquidez (1990).  furthermore, in the miller decision, they only permitted prosecution for possession of a sawed-off shotgun because the defense had not presented testimony and they therefore accepted the argument of the government that such weapons have no military value -- they held that the amendment protected the individual right to possess military weapons. unfortunately, no second amendment case has successfully gotten to the court in fifty years. however, that does not change the interpretation.  furthermore, it appears that others disagree with you as well, vis:   ""the conclusion is thus inescapable that the history, concept,   and wording of the second amendment to the constitution of the   united states, as well as its interpretation by every major   commentator and court in the first half-century after its ratifi-   cation, indicates that what is protected is an individual right   of a private citizen to own and carry firearms in a peaceful manner.""    - report of the subcommittee on the constitution of the      committee on the judiciary, united states senate,      97th congress, second session ( february 1982 )  you might rightfully ask ""well then, what does that first bit about militias mean?""  well, ""militia"" in historical context basically means the whole of the adult males of the country. (indeed, the u.s. code still defines ""militia"" as all armed men over the age of 17).     ""the militia comprised all males physically capable of acting     in concert for the common defense ....  and ... these men were     expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of     the kind in common use at the time."" 	- supreme court of the united states,  u.s. v. miller (1939).  the reason for the phrase being there was to explain the rationale behind the amendment, which was this: by depending on the people to bear arms in defense of the country, no centralization of military power could ever occur which would permit tyranny -- in short, the government would remain perpetually in fear of the people, rather than the other way around.     ""no free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.  the strongest reason    for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last    resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.""      - thomas jefferson, proposal virginia constitution, june 1776        1 thomas jefferson papers, 334 (c. j. boyd, ed., 1950).     ""and what country can preserve its liberties, if its rulers are not    warned from time to time that this people preserve the spirit of    resistance ?  let them take arms ... the tree of liberty must be    refreshed from time to time, with the blood of patriots and tyrants.""      - thomas jefferson (letter to william s. smith, 1787, in        jefferson, on democracy 20, s. padover, ed., 1939).     ""before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed;    as they are in almost every kingdom of europe.  the supreme    power in america cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword;    because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute    a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on    any pretense, raised in the united states.""      - noah webster, ""an examination into the leading principles        of the federal constitution"" (1787), in pamphlets on the        constitution of the united states (p. ford, 1888).  you may disagree with the second amendment, and wish that it be repealed, but please do not pretend that it isn't there and that it doesn't mean what it says. you might argue that conditions have changed and that it should no longer be present, but you can't imagine it away.  i could fill a book with detailed argumentation. many have already.  however, none of this has anything to do with cryptography.  lets get it out of here. if you insist on discussing this, please do it in talk.politics.guns, where people will gladly discuss this matter with you.  -- perry metzger		pmetzger@shearson.com",11,sci.crypt

"[ . . .]  i am a relativist who would like to answer your question, but the way you phrase the question makes it unanswerable.  the concepts of ""right"" and ""wrong"" (or ""correct/incorrect"" or ""true/false"") belong to the domain of epistemological rather than moral questions.  it makes no sense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong, although it is legitimate to ask if it is good (or better than another position).  let me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives of epistemology and ethics:  perception and motivation, respectively. one can certainly ask if a percept is ""right"" (correct, true, veridical) or ""wrong"" (incorrect, false, illusory).  but it makes little sense to ask if a motive is true or false.  on the other hand, it is strange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil, but one can certainly ask that question about motives.  therefore, your suggested answers (a)-(c) simply can't be considered: they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment.  now the problem with (d) is that it is double-barrelled:  i agree with the first part (that the ""rightness"" of a moral position is a meaningless question), for the reasons stated above.  but that is irrelevant to the alleged implication (not an implication at all) that one cannot feel peace is better than war.  i certainly can make value judgments (bad, better, best) without asserting the ""correctness"" of the position.  sorry for the lengthy dismissal of (a)-(d).  my short (e) answer is that when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue, neither is right (correct) or wrong (incorrect).  they simply hold different moral values (feelings).",0,alt.atheism

"no.  zeno's paradox is resolved by showing that integration or an infinite series of decreasing terms can sum to a finite result.   well, suppose a probe emitting radiation at a constant frequency was sent towards a black hole.  as it got closer to the event horizon, the red shift would keep increasing.  the period would get longer and longer, but it would never stop.  an observer would not observe the probe actually reaching the event horizon.  the detected energy from the probe would keep decreasing, but it wouldn't vanish.  exp(-t) never quite reaches zero.  i guess the above probably doesn't make things any more clear, but hopefully you will get the general idea maybe.",19,talk.religion.misc

"a word of warning, though:  kryptonite also sells almost useless cable locks under the kryptonite name.  when i obtained my second motorcycle, i migrated one of my kryptonite  u-locks from my bicycle to the new bike.  i then went out shopping for a new lock for the bicycle.  for about the same money ($20) i had the choice of a kryptonite cable lock (advantages: lock front and back wheels on bicycle and keep them both, kryptonite name) or a cheesy no-name u-lock (advantages: real steel). i chose the kryptonite cable.  after less than a week, i took it back in disgust and exchanged it for the cheesy no-name u-lock.  first, the krypto cable i bought is not made by kryptonite, is not covered by the kryptonite guarantee, and doesn't even approach kryptonite standards of quality and quality assurance.  it is just some generic made-in-taiwan cable lock with the kryptonite name on it.  secondly, the latch engagement mechanism is something of a joke.  i don't know if mine was a particularly poor example, but it was often quite frustrating to get the latch to positively engage, and sometimes it would seem to engage, only to fall open when i went to unlock it.  thirdly, the lock has a little plastic door on the keyway which serves the sole purpose of frustrating any attempt to insert the key in the  dark.  i didn't try it (obviously), but i have my doubts that the  lock mechanism would stand up to an ""insert screwdriver and torque"" attack.  fourthly, the cable was not, in my opinion, of sufficient thickness to  deter theft (for my piece of crap bicycle, that is).  all cables suffer the weakness that they can be cut a few strands at a time.  if you are patient you can cut cables with fingernail clippers.  aviation snips would go  through the cable in well under a minute.    --",8,rec.motorcycles

"completed  why would you dispose a channel if you are going to play more sounds soon? if you are trying to write a game, you shouldn't be using sndplay. instead, make a channel and use buffercmds to play sounds on it. it works great. you can add callbacks to the channel also to let you know when the channel is getting empty. before it gets empty.  7.1,  callbacks are very reliable, i found them 100% reliable, even under system 4.1. i was doing continuous background sound with interrupting sound effects on system 6.0 with the im-v documentation.  you probably were cancelling your callback commands out of your channels, of course you didn't get called. in general, if you have problems with sounds working when you play one per channel and then close the channel (with the related slowdown), but then when you play more than one you don't work, then you are adding more than one synthesizer to a channel, possibly the same one multiple times. this might be because you are calling sndplay on a preexisting channel with a sound resource which adds the sampled sound synthesizer to the channel first thing before it plays. most sampled sounds have this command at the start of them. you need to resedit the sound and remove that command, then when you create your channel, specify the sampled sound synthesizer to be the channel's synth. then you can use asynch sndplay's all you want. you'll probably want to switch to buffercmd's, since you are going to have to use snddocommand anyway to add callbacks.  now before you go ahead and tell me i am full of it, and the sound manager doesn't work for games, remember, spectre uses it. and it works great. if spectre can spare the cpu time, you can too.  one little disclaimer: there are some out there who say the sound manager in the iisi can't be made to work right. i'm not sure either way, but i know for sure that you can make your sounds work 100% correctly on every other machine using the sound manager.",4,comp.sys.mac.hardware

"srebrenica's doctor recounts town's living hell       by laura pitter     tuzla, bosnia, reuter - neret mujanovic was a pathologist when he trekked through the mountains to the besieged muslim town of srebrenica last august.     but after treating 4,000 mangled victims of bosnia's bloody war, he considers himself a surgeon.     ``now i'm a surgeon with great experience although i have no license to practice. but if i operate on a person and he lives normally that's the greatest license a surgeon could have.''     evacuated by the u.n. this week to his home town of tuzla, the muslim physician gave an eyewitness medical assessment of the horrors of the year-long serb siege of srebrenica and the suffering of the thousands trapped there.     ``i lived through hell together with the people of srebrenica. all those who lived through this are the greatest heroes that humanity can produce,'' he told reporters.     mujanovic, 31, had practiced for two months as an assistant at a local hospital in tuzla, but before going to srebrenica he had never performed a surgical operation on his own. now he says he has performed major surgery 1,396 times, relying on books for guidance, amputating arms and legs 150 times, usually without anesthetic, delivering 350 babies and performing four cesarean sections.     he worked 18-to-19-hour days, slept in the hospital for the first 10 weeks after his arrival last aug. 5 and treated  4,000 patients.     he arrived after making the trek over mountains on foot from tuzla, 60 miles northwest of srebrenica. about 50 other people carried in supplies and 350 soldiers guided and protected him through guerrilla terrain, he said.     his worst memory was of 10 days ago when seven serb shells landed within one minute in an area half the size of a football field, killing 36 people immediately and wounding 102. half of the dead were women and children.     the people had come out for a rare day of sunshine and the children were playing soccer. ``there was no warning ... the blood flowed like a river in the street,'' he said.     ``there were pieces of women all around and you could not piece them together. one woman holding her two children in her hands was lying with them on the ground dead. they had no heads.''     before mujanovic arrived with his supplies conditions were deplorable, he said. many deaths could have been prevented had the hospital had surgical tools, facilities and medicine.     the six general practitioners who had been operating before he arrived had even less surgical experience than he did. ``they didn't know the basic principles for amputating limbs.''     once he arrived the situation improved, he said, but by mid-september he had run out of supplies.     ``bandages were washed and boiled five times ... sometimes they were falling apart in my hands,'' he said. doctors had no anesthetic and could not give patients alcohol to numb the pain because it increased bleeding.     ``people were completely conscious during amputations and stomach operations,'' he said. blood transfusions were impossible because they had no facilities to test blood types.     ``i felt destroyed psychologically,'' mujanovic said.     the situation improved after dec. 4, when a convoy arrived from the belgian medical group medecins sans frontieres.     but mujanovic said the military predicament worsened in mid-december after bosnian serbs began a major offensive in the region. ``every day we had air strikes and shellings.''     then the hunger set in.     between mid-december and mid-march, when u.s. planes began air dropping food, between 20 and 30 people were dying every day from complications associated with malnutrition, he said.     ``i know for sure that the air drop operation saved the people from massive death by hunger and starvation,'' he said.     according to mujanovic, around 5,000 people died in srebrenica, 1,000 of them children, during a year of siege.     mujanovic plans to return to srebrenica in three weeks after visiting his wife, who is ill in tuzla.     ``they say i'm a hero,'' he said. ``there were thousands of people standing at the sides of the road, crying and waving when i left. and i cried too.''",13,sci.med

"first of all, ""ceremonial law"" is an extrascriptural term.  it is sometimes used as a framework to view scripture.  but if you look at collosions, without going into it with the assumption that the sabbath cannot be  a ceremonial law, you will see that it does refer to the sabbath.  against us to his cross, and therefore we should not be judged in what what food we eat, what we drink, the keeping of new moons and holy days, or the keeping of the sabbath.  the word for sabbath in this verse is ""sabbaton"" and is used throughout the new testament to refer to the 7th day.  if there is any scripture from which we get the idea of the ceremonial law, this is one of them, and the sabbath is listed among the ceremonial laws.  if one goes into this with the fundamental assumption ""the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law"" then he will have to find some way around it, like saying that this can only refer to the other sabbath holy days besides the 7th day, because ""the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law.""  but paul is very careful in his letters to add some kind of parenthetcal  statement if there is anything that can be seen as a liscence to sin in his writings.  also, why is the sabbath absent from the epistles (except for hebrews 4, which talks about the rest that comes through faith?)  surely it would have been a big problem for first century christians living in a society that did not rest on the 7th day.  especially slaves. many new converst were slaves.  it would have been difficult for slaves to rest on the sabbath if it had been mandatory.  why is there no mention of this in the epistles?",15,soc.religion.christian

"[discussing the use of irq 7]    to put it a little differently:   - irq 7 is the de facto standard interrupt assigned to be used by the    printer adapter to announce its completion of some activity.   - dos doesn't monitor irq 7; it uses other means to determine when it's    time to send out another byte to the printer.   - most (all?) (hardware) printer adapters have the ability to disable    the use of irq 7, usually by merely breaking the connection between    the isa pin and the associated driver.  other adapters control the    irq line by a tri-state driver, and by programming just leave it    in the high-impedence mode.   - unfortunately, there are a lot of adapter cards which use bistate    drivers (i.e., either assert high or assert low) for the irq lines    rather than tristate drivers (assert high, assert low, or don't    assert anything).  the presence of such a card on an irq line precludes    the use of that irq by any other adapter unless it is physically     disconnected by a jumper.     (incidentally, note that there's no requirement that a card hold    the irq line low when no interrupt is desired.  if that were true    you would have to somehow tie down all unconnected irq lines, and    that certainly isn't a requirement.)   - non-dos operating systems (os/2, nt (?), various unices or whatever the    proper plural of unix might be) require the use of irq 7 for performance    reasons.    and the sb16, alas, is one of the cards which uses bistate drivers.",3,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

"well, there *is* a difference.  i don't happen to have my sae manual handy, but oil viscosity in general _decreases_ with temperature.  the sae numbers are based on a `typical' curve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of a room-temperature 90-weight at 0c, down to (say) that of a room-temperature  5-weight at 20c, for a typical 40-weight oil.  oils that are designed for operation in `normal' temperatures just have a weight specification.  oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly cold temperatures have a `w' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold place, you'd stick 10w in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer, to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.  modern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature. as a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves.  a multi-vis specification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal' operating temperature and a `cold' one (though i can't remember the numbers...).  in any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference.  remember that your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and radiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or something.  any weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized oil.  thin oil won't (in general) lubricate as well at temperature, thicker oil will (like a 20w50) will lubricate better at temperature,  but not as well during startup, when most engine wear occurs.    if you're planning on making long drives, the 20w50 is probably fine (esp. in the summer) in your 10w40 car.  but if you're making short drives, stick to the 10w40.",7,rec.autos

""they were the only bodies brought to us. remember the chaos and the fact that we are  muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within 24 hours.""  of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14 years old.  gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and axes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  exposure in  the highland snows killed the last three.  thirty-three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises cut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to professor youssifov's report. those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed, mr rasulov said.  files  from  mr  rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still disorganised -  lists of 44  azeri militiamen are dead  here, six policemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the names of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. the most heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far comes  from towfiq  manafov,  an azeri  investigator  who took  a helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  hojali  on  27 february.  ""there were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to count properly: 470-500  in hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream and the road and 85-100  visible around nakhchivanik village,"" mr manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter pilot.  ""people waved up  to us for help. we saw  three dead children and one  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  the  live one  was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. we tried to land but armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to return.""  there  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in hojali at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by armenian forces.  the independent, london, 12/6/'92  serdar argic",17,talk.politics.mideast
"may 13, 1993  _five russian soldiers sentenced to death in azerbaijan_   moscow (upi) -- five soldiers who served in russia's 7th army stationed in armenia were sentenced to death in the azerbaijani capital baku thursday for allegedly ""carrying out diversions and killing 30 azeri soldiers.""   a statement released by the news service of azeri president abulfaz elchibey said ""the sentence was final and was not subject to protest or appeal,"" the  russian state news agency itar-tass reported.   but the russian foreign ministry issued an appeal for the men to be handed over to the authorities in moscow for punishment.   ""this would accord with modern standards of humanity towards those who have committed crimes,"" the statement reads.   the five men, together with another soldier who received a 15-year prison sentence, were captured in september 1992 by azeri police in the kelbadzhar district of azerbaijan, between nagorno-karabakh and armenia.   the supreme court in baku said the men had gone through special training in a company of the russian 7th army in the armenian capital yerevan, after which they were sent across the armenian-azeri border into nagorno-karabakh to  carry out diversions against azeri troops.   however, the russian foreign ministry statement claimed they had deserted the russian army and were fighting as mercenaries with armenian armed forces in the battle zone round karabakh.   nagorno-karabakh is an armenian-populated enclave within azerbaijan which for five years has been fighting for independence from baku in a war that has left many thousands dead and uprooted hundreds of thousands from their homes.   both yerevan and baku have always claimed that russian servicemen stationed in these caucasian republics, who were left behind after the break-up of the  soviet union, are fighting as mercenaries in the karabakh war.   the statement from moscow said the russian side repeatedly appealed to the azerbaijani government to show humanity and leniency in their treatment of the six men, and to hand them over to the russian authorities.   it said that president boris yeltsin himself sent a letter with this request  to his azeri counterpart elchibey. itar-tass said that the soldiers' defense attorneys had lodged an appeal for clemency.",17,talk.politics.mideast

"[heats of formation deleted]  the major problem with this is that the reaction takes place in an acid solution. pbso4 is soluble in an acid solution and will not precipitate out.  also, h2so4 is in a water solution as 2h30+ and so4--.  thus the heats of formation of pbso4 and h2so4 are for the most part irrelevant.   as it turns out the reaction is indeed exothermic (heat producing). (more about this later.)  what actually happens to make the battery completely useless is this: (we're talking lead-acid batteries of course) the battery slowly self discharges.  as this discharge takes place two things happen. -the level of pb++ ions in the acid solution increases (i.e. the lead            and lead oxide plates are dissolved).         -the level of h30+ ions in the acid solution decreases (i.e. the solution            becomes less acidic, or more like water if you like). now, as the post to which i am responding correctly stated, pbso4 will precipitate in a water (non-acid) solution.  when the battery dies (i.e. is fully discharged) we end up with a high concentration of pb++ and so4-- in water.  so pbso4 forms in the solution and falls to the bottom of the battery (of course this happens in varying degrees, the more discharged, the more precipitate forms).  the precipitate forms a conductive layer on the bottom of the battery.  if there is enough of the lead and lead oxide plates left to touch the precipitate (more common in a newer battery) a dead short results.  i have seen products in automotive shops to correct this condition, but they are for the most part useless.  they can dissolve the pbso4 but cannot restore the lead and lead oxide plates properly.  you may have some success with these products for a newer battery.  [stuff deleted] [stuff deleted]  this stuff is just made up by the author and is completely invalid. in fact the discharge reaction takes place at a higher rate at higher temperatures.  a logical consequence of the above argument is this: ""if you really want your car to start, lower the battery temperature to  -50 to 'pull' the reaction along.""  we all know from experience (at  least those of us in canada do (it gets cold up here)) that this is not true.  if we want to start our car on a really cold day we warm the battery.  (besides which, there is not enough energy released through self discharge  to appreciably raise the temperature.  the air would amply dissipate any  such heat, whether the bottom of the battery was insulated or not.  this  is of course irrelevant, since you would want the battery to be cool  during storage.)",12,sci.electronics

"a question for you - can you give me the name of an organization or a philosophy or a political movement, etc., which has never had anything evil done in its name?  you're missing a central teaching of christianity - man is inherently sinful.  we are saved through faith by grace.  knowing that, believing that, does not make us without sin.  furthermore, not all who consider themselves ""christians"" are (even those who manage to head their own ""churches"").  ""not everyone who says to me, 'lord, lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my father who is in heaven."" - matt. 7:21.   again, what historical documents do you trust?  do you think hannibal crossed the alps?  how do you know?  how do you know for sure?  what historical documents have stood the scrutiny and the attempts to dis- credit it as well as the bible has?   well, it's really a shame you feel this way.  no one can browbeat you into believing, and those who try will probably only succeed in driving you further away.  you need to ask yourself some difficult questions: 1) is there an afterlife, and if so, does man require salvation to attain it.  if the answer is yes, the next question is 2) how does man attain this salvation - can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certain modern offshoots like the ""new age movement"" teach or does he require god's help?  3) if the latter, in what form does - indeed, in what form can such help come?  needless to say, this discussion could take a lifetime, and for some people it did comprise their life's writings, so i am hardly in a position to offer the answers here - merely pointers to what to ask.  few, of us manage to have an unshaken faith our entire lives (certainly not me). the spritual life is a difficult journey (if you've never read ""a pilgrim's progress,"" i highly recommend this greatest allegory of the english language).   now i see by your close that one possible source of trouble for you may be a conflict between your politcal beliefs and your religious upbringing.  you wrote that ""i (in my own faith) accept and live my life by many if not most of the teachings of christ"".  well, christ referred to god as ""my father"", not ""my mother"", and while the ""maleness"" of god is not the same as the maleness of those of us humans who possess a y chromosome, it does not honor god to refer to him as female purely to be trendy, non-discriminatory, or politically correct.  this in no way disparages women (nor is it my intent to do so by my use of the male pronoun to refer to both men and women -  english just does not have a decent neuter set of pronouns).  after all, god chose a woman as his only human partner in bringing christ into the human population.  well, i'm not about to launch into a detailed discussion of the role of women in christianity at 1am with only 6 hours of sleep in the last 63, and for that reason i also apologize for any shortcomings in this article.  i just happened across yours and felt moved to reply.  i hope i may have given you, and anyone else who finds himself in a similar frame of mind, something to contemplate.",15,soc.religion.christian

"government-mandated energy conservation is unnecessary and wastful, study finds    washington, dc -- the energy tax and subsidized energy-efficiency   measures supported by president clinton and energy secretary hazel   o'leary are based on faulty assumptions, a new study from the cato   institute points out.      according to jerry taylor, cato's director of natural resource studies,   we are not running out of sources of energy. the world now has almost 10   times the proven oil reserves it had in 1950 and twice the reserves of   1970. proven reserves of coal and natural gas have increased just as   dramatically.      when standards of living, population densities, and industrial   structures are controlled for, the united states is no less energy   efficient than japan and more energy efficient than many of the group   of seven nations.      energy independence provides little protection against domestic oil   price shocks because the energy economy is global. moreover, since the   cost of oil represents only about 2 percent of gross national product,   even large increases in the price of oil would have little impact on the   overall u.s. economy.      market economies are, on average, 2.75 times more energy efficient per   $1,000 of gnp than are centrally planned economies.      utilities' subsidized energy-efficiency measurs, known as demand-side   management programs, encourage free riders, overuse of competing resource   inputs, an competitive inequities. furthermore, dsm programs do not   reduce demand.      taylor concludes that government-mandated energy conservation imposes   unnecessary costs on consumers and wastes, not conserves, energy; that   subsidizing energy-conservation technologies will stymie, not advance,   gains in energy conservation; and that central control over the lifeblood   of modern society--energy--would transfer tremendous power to the state   at the expense of the individual.

"[insert deletion of unnecessary quote]   first of all, god does not take any sort of pleasure from punishing people.  he will have mercy on whom he will have mercy and compassion on whom he will have compassion (ex 33:19).  however, if he enjoyed punishing people and sending them to hell, then why would he send jesus to ""seek and save that which was lost"" (luke 19:10)?  you asked for it.  2 peter 2:4-ff talks about how those who are ungodly are punished. matthew 25:31-46 is also very clear that those who do not righteous in god's eyes will be sent to hell for eternity. 2 thessalonians 1:6-10 states that those who cause trouble for the disciples ""will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the lord"". 2 thessalonians 2:9-12 talks about those who refuse to love the truth being condemned. revelation 21:6-8 talks about the difference between those who overcomes and those who do not.  those who do not, listed in verse 8, will be in the ""fiery lake of burning sulfur"". revelation 14:9-12 gives the indication that those who follow the beast ""will be tormented with burning sulfur"" and there being ""no rest day or night"" for them because of it. psalm 9:17:  ""the wicked return to the grave, all the nations that forget god.""  i think those should be sufficient to prove the point.   joe fisher  [in the following i'm mostly playing ""devil's advocate"".  i'm not advocating either position.  my concern is that people understand that it's possible to see these passages in different ways.  it's possible to see eternal destruction as just that -- destruction.  rev often uses the term ""second death"".  the most obvious understanding of that would seem to be final extinction.  the problem is that the nt speaks both of eternal punishment and of second death.  i.e. it uses terms that can be understood either way.  my concern here is not to convince you of one view or the other, but to help people understand that there's a wide enough variety of images that it's possible to understand them either way.  as tom albrecht commented, the primary point is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire, whatever the details.  (to make things more interesting, luke 20:35 implies that the damned don't get resurrected at all.  presumably they just stay dead. -- yes i'm aware that it's possible to  understand this passage in a non-literal way.)  2 peter 2:4-ff is talking about angels, and talks about holding them in hell until the final judgement.  this isn't eternal punishement.  matthew 25:31-46 talks about sending the cursed into eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.  the fact that the fire is eternal doesn't mean that people will last in its flames forever. particularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been prepared for the devil and his angels.  rev 20 and 21 talk about the eternal fire as well.  they say that the beast and the false prophet will be tormented forever in it.  when talking about people being thrown into it (20:13-14), it is referred to as ""the second death"". this sounds more like extinction than eternal torment.  is is possible that the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such as the devil, and humans?  2 thessalonians 1:6-10 similarly, what is ""everlasting destruction""? this is not necessarily eternal torment.  this one can clearly be understood either way, but i think it's at least possible to think that everlasting is being used to contrast the kind of destruction that can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs in eternity.  2 thessalonians 2:8 again talks about destruction. revelation 21:6-8: see comment above revelation 14:9-12 is probably the best of the quotes.  even there, it doesn't explicitly say that the people suffer forever.  it says that the smoke (and presumably the fire) is eternal, and that  there is no respite from it.  but it doesn't say that the people are tormented forever.  psalm 9:17:  i don't see that it says anything relevant to this issue.",15,soc.religion.christian

"from denning:     the skipjack encryption algorithm    f, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips    n, a 30-bit serial number    u, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip     e[m; k], the encrypted message stream, and     e[e[k; u] + n; f], a law enforcement block.    where the session key is k, and is transmitted encrypted in the unit key u. which along with the serial number n is encrypted in the family key f.  presumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differential analysis).  postulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chip and its communications channel.  the function of this spoof chip is twofold:      	1) transmit channel  	    the spoof chip xors the 30 bit encrypted serial number with 	    a secondary keying variable.  this renders the serial number 	    unrecoverable with just the family key  	2) receive channel  	    the spoof chip xors the incoming encrypted serial number 	    with a secondary keying variable (assuming integrity of the 	    law enforcement block is necessary for local operation - 	    checksums, sequence control, etc.).  this has the net result of hiding the serial number.  it is probable theere is a known plaintext pattern used as a filler in the block containing n (34 bits as used in generating u, u1,u2) correctness of the law enforcement block can be determined with only the family key f.  whereas, no one has proposed federal agencies be denied f, and because they could recover it themselves, the correctness of the serial number can be tested by examining the pad bits of n in e[n; f].  the one could selectively alter the law enforcement block as above, but the mutilation could be detected.  a better approach would be to mutilate the entire law enforcement block.  if it were done with a group encryption scheme such as des or (presumably) skipjack, the chances the law enforcement block can be recovered are lessened.  what do you want to bet the transmission protocol can be recognized and the serial numbers decrypted in a target search?  when digital transmission becomes widely available, would there be a requirement that clipper protocol transmissions be refused when containing mutilated law enforcement blocks?  one way to avoid notice, would be to spoof protocol information of the block containing m, as well as spoofing the law enforcement block.  the goal is to use a secure communications scheme, without redress to  detection or key k interception (contained encrypted within the law enforcement block).  the data stream is returned to its original state for use by the clipper chip (or system) if required, for proper operation.  it is somewhat improbable that the entire protocol will be contained within the clipper chip, yet likely that sequence of events will be tested for, requiring a valid law enforcement block to be received before accepting and decrypting e(m; k);  the spoof chip could be implemented anywhere in the protocols, including on the resulting serial data stream.  existing clipper products could be subborned.  after all, they are high security encryption systems right?  super encipherment/encryption could allow the chip to be used without redress to detection of the use of the chip, or disclosure of the serial number.  security must be adequate to deny the serial number, which should not be recoverable by other means.  one can see the use of cut outs for procurring clipper phones, or once the number of units is high enough, stealing them.  it would be a mistake on the part of authority, but nice from a point of privacy, if the serial number n were not associated with a particular clipper chip or lot of chips through the manufacturing and  distribution process.  hopefully the list of known missing or stolen clipper serial numbers n encrypted with f, and the protocols are not  sufficient plaintext to attact the super encrypted clipper stream. this could be further made difficult by altering the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper stream to that of the super encrypted stream.  detection of an encrypted stream could tip off the use of the aforementioned scheme.  ******************************************************************************  if you could capture valid law enforcement blocks not your own, and use them in a codebook sustitution with your own, where they point to a valid law enforcement block stored in a library utilizing a session key matching the remainder of the transmission, you could simply out and out lie, yet deliver to monitoring and/or hostile forces a seemingly valid law enforcement block.   these captured law enforcement blocks would be used as authenticators, such as in a manually keyed encryption system.  fending this off would require escalation in examining the protocols and blocks in the transmission.  the m code stream  might be independently attacked based on knowledge of clipper chip protocols as revealed plaintext.  this could be invalidated by changing the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper m stream and the actual transmitted stream, under the control of a secure key generator synchronized between endpoints.  the useful life time of captured law enforcement blocks might be limited based on hostile forces using them as targets following transmission interception.  you would need a large number of them, but, hey there's supposed to be millions of these things, right?  adding time stamps to the encrypted law enforcement block is probably impractical, who wants an encryption chip with a real time clock?  *****************************************************************************",11,sci.crypt

"i differ with our moderator on this.  i thought the whole idea of god coming down to earth to live as one of us ""subject to sin and death"" (as one of the consecration prayers in the book of common prayer (1979) puts it) was that jesus was tempted, but did not succumb.  if sin is not part of the basic definition of humanity, then jesus ""fully human"" (nicea) would not be ""subject to sin"", but then the resurrection loses some of its meaning, because we encounter our humanity most powerfully when we sin.  to distinguish between ""human"" and ""fallen human"" makes jesus less like one of us at the time we need him most.   first, the monophysites inherited none of nestorius's version -- they  were on the opposite end of the spectrum from him.  second, the historical record suggests that the positions attributed to nestorius were not as extreme as his (successful) opponents (who wrote the conventional history) claimed.  mainly nestorius opposed the term theotokos for mary, arguing (i think correctly) that a human could not be called mother of god.  i mean, in the athanasian creed we talk about the son ""uncreate"" -- surely even  arians would concede that jesus existed long before mary.  anyway, nestorius's opponents claimed that by saying mary was not theotokos, that he claimed that she only gave birth to the human nature of jesus, which would require two seperate and distinct natures.  the argument fails though, because mary simply gave birth to jesus, who preexisted her either divinely, if you accept ""nestorianism"" as commonly defined, or both natures intertwined, a la chalcedon.  second, i am not sure that ""nestorianism"" is not a better alternative than the orthodox view.  after all, i find it hard to believe that pre-incarnation that jesus's human nature was in heaven; likewise post-ascension.  i think rather that god came to earth and took our nature upon him.  it was a seperate nature, capable of being tempted as in gethsemane (since i believe the divine nature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine nature prevailed.  comments on the above warmly appreciated.  jason albert  [there may be differences in what we mean by ""subject to sin"".  the original complaint was from someone who didn't see how we could call jesus fully human, because he didn't sin.  i completely agree that jesus was subject to temptation.  i simply object to the idea that by not succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  i believe that you do not have to sin in order to be human.  i again apologize for confusing nestorianism and monophysitism.  i agree with you, and have said elsewhere, that there's reason to think that not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in fact heretical.  there are scholars who maintain that nestorius was not nestorian.  i have to confess that the first time i read some of the correspondence between nestorius and his opponents, i thought he got the better of them.  however, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to chalcedon was an advance, and that nestorius was at the very least ""rash and dogmatic"" (as the editor of ""the christological controversy"" refers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  as regular usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much an impediment as being wrong.  furthermore, he did say some things that i think are problematical.  he responds to a rather mild letter from cyril with a flame worthy of usenet.  in it he says ""to attribute also to [the logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristics of the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother, either the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the greeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of arius and apollinaris and the others.  those who are thus carried away with the idea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divine logos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some degree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his fearfulness ...  these things are taken falsely when they are put off on the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us who perpetrate the falsehood.""  it's all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between humanity and divinity.  but the whole concept of incarnation is based on exactly the idea that the divine logos does in fact have ""to some degree"" a part in being born, growing up, and dying.  of course it must be understood that there's a certain indirectness in the logos' participation in these things.  but there must be some sort of identification between the divine and human, or we don't have an incarnation at all.  nestorius seemed to think in black and white terms, and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with this area.  you say ""i find it hard to believe that pre-incarnation that jesus's human nature was in heaven.""  i don't think that's required by orthodox doctrine.  it's the divine logos that is eternal.",15,soc.religion.christian

"actually the reasons you don't see so many cooling towers at fossil plants are 1) fossil units (multiple units per plant) are generally smaller than nuclear plants.  300 mwe seemed to be a very popular size when many fossil plants were built.  the average nuclear plant is 1000 mwe.  2) many fossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were adopted (""why those old dirt burners can't harm anything, let 'em go."").   3) powered draft cooling towers, low enough to the ground to be generally not visible from off-site, are quite popular with fossil plants.  4) fossil plants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears.    actually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants of similar size.  the issues are the same regardless of where the  heat comes from.  condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in order to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine.  the condenser pressure is normally water's vapor pressure at the condensing temperature.  it is desirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because  moisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine  low pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity causes erosion of the condenser tubes.  the coldest and thus lowest pressure condensing environment is always the best.    a related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell (where the water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes.)  since the condenser is at a very low pressure, the only force driving the  condensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity.  if the condensate is too  hot or the gravity head is too low, the condensate will reflash into steam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate.  this is a particularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all costs.    the hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant in order to provide a gravity head to the pumps.  how much lower  they must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in the hotwell.  typically hotwell temperatures run between 100 and 120  degrees depending on the temperature of the river water (this term is used to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower system is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water is pumped.)  when the river water temperature is high in the summer, operators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order  to provide more gravity head.  there is a tradeoff involved since higher hotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the condenser area.  at least in the east and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the air :-), the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge water from the cooling towers.  the temperature of the discharge water from the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and humidity.  it is very rare in the east to hear of actual river water temperatures exceeding 70 degrees.  a vast difference from the typical ""95-95"" days (95 degrees, 95% humidity) we see routinely in the east. it is not unusual, particularly where the econazis have been successful in clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant, for the plant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets too high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessive pressure.   true.  actually secondary plant (the part that makes electricity and feeds feedwater to the boiler) water chemistry has been the bastard  stepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves. the plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understood the costs of impure water.  by ""impure"", i mean water with a few dozen extra micromho of conductivity and/or a few ppm of dissolved oxygen.  secondary water is now typically the most pure one will  find outside the laboratory.  john",12,sci.electronics
the object of a cooling tower is to distribute dissolved salts in  cooling water over large areas of farmland and to therefore decrease farm subsidies for non-producers by rendering their land infertile.  a side effect of this deficit-reduction program is that they provide a low-t reservoir for a variety of industrial processes.  now you know.   --,12,sci.electronics

"someone sent me this faq by e-mail and i post my response here.  [i'm not enforcing the inclusion limits on this faq because most of our readers probably haven't seen it.  --clh]  christ warns that anyone who ""breaks one of the least of these commandments *and* teaches otheres to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven"" (matt. 5:19.  this faq is so full of error that i must respond to it.  i hope that whoever maintains will remove from it the partisan theology.   1.  the law was known to man before it was revealed on mount sinai.  rom 4:15 notes that ""where no law is, there is no transgression.""  not only did sin exist before sinai (eden), but the sabbath was kept before it was revealed on sinai (ex 16).  2.  the problem with the first covenant was not the law, but the promise which undergirded it.  god wanted to perform his will in the lives of the people, but in their ignorance after 400 years of slavery, they promised ""what ever he says to do we will do.""  that is why the new covenant is based on ""better promises"" (heb. 8:6).  rather than do away with the law god promised to ""put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts"" (heb. 8:10).  3.  including the sabbath in the acts 15 is selective inclusion.  the sabbath was more important to the jews than circumcision.  if any attempt had been made to do away with the sabbath the reaction would have been even more strident than is recorded in acts 15.  do not confuse the weekly sabbath of the decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at any time of the week and were part of the law (ceremonial) which was *added* because of transgression (of the moral law) (gal 3:19).  4.  israel stands for god's people of all time.  that is why god *grafted* the gentiles in.  roma 9:4 says that the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service of god and the promises belong to israelites.   in explanation paul makes it clear that being born into israel is not enough ""for they are not all israel, which are of israel"" v 6.  then in gal 3:19 he says ""if ye be christ's, then are ye abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.""  all christians are abraham's seed, jews, israelites.  not physically, for that is not the criterion, but spiritually.  we are joint heirs with jesus based on the promise god made to all his people the israelites.   people would probably agree but they are wrong.  how can the sabbath commandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the ceremonial laws?  you are not free to choose your time of worship.  even if you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan sun worship.  would you rather give up a day which god blessed, sanctified, and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders agree has not biblical foundation (see sabbath admissions in soc.religion.christian.bible-study). i do not care what calvin or any theologian says.  my guide is what god says.  if being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law, why is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the sabbath commandment, which is the only one god thought was important enough to say *remember*?  if you study the word deeply you will note that the message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but freed by the grace of god.  if a cop pulls me over for speeding, then in court i ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me grace, do i walk out of the court saying ""i can now go on speeding, for i am now under grace?""  being under grace i now drive within the speed limit.  paul adds to it in rom. 3:31 ""di we then make void the law through faith?  god forbid: yea, we establish the law.""  ""wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good"" (rom. 7:12).   do you prefer implication to fact?  a careful study of the acts 20 shows that the meeting was on saturday night and that on sunday morning paul did not go to a worship service, but set off on a long journey by foot to assos.  in icor 16 there is no way you can equate ""lay by him in store"" with ""go to a worship service.""  wrong.  these are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law, not the sabbath day of the moral law. why would you prefer to twist and turn, relying on different arguments which conflict with each other, rather than obey a simple request from a god who loved you enough to die for you.  jesus died because the law could not be changed.  why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a broken law if all you need to do is change the law.  penalties for law breaking means the law is immutable.  that is why it is no sin not to follow the demands of the ceremonial laws.  it will always be a sin to make false gods, to violate god's name, to break the sabbath, to steal, to kill, etc.  except it you disagree.  but then your opinion has no weight when placed next to the word of god.  darius  [it's not clear how much more needs to be said other than the faq.  i think paul's comments on esteeming one day over another (rom 14) is probably all that needs to be said.  i accept that darius is doing what he does in honor of the lord.  i just wish he might equally accept that those who ""esteem all days alike"" are similarly doing their best to honor the lord.  however i'd like to be clear that i do not think there's unambiguous proof that regular christian worship was on the first day.  as i indicated, there are responses on both of the passages cited.  the difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually about something else.  they both look like they are talking about nnregular christian meetings, but neither explicitly says ""and they gathered every sunday for worship"".  we get various pieces of information, but nothing aimed at answering this question.    act 2:26 describes christians as participating both in jewish temple worship and in christian communion services in homes.  obviously the temple worship is on the sabbath.  acts 13:44 is an example of christians participating in them.  unfortunately it doesn't tell us what day christians met in their houses.  acts 20:7, despite darius' confusion, is described by acts as occuring on sunday.  (i see no reason to impose modern definitions of when days start, when the biblical text is clear about what was meant.)  the wording implies to me that this was a normal meeting.  it doesn't say they gathered to see paul off, but that when they were gathered for breaking bread, paul talked about his upcoming travel.  but that's just not explicit enough to be really convincing.  similarly with 1 cor 16:2.  it says that on the first day they should set aside money for paul's collection.  now if you want to believe that they gathered specially to do this, or that they did it in their homes, i can't disprove it, but the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be when they normally gather for worship, and if they were expected to do it in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day. so i think the most obvious reading of this is that ""on the first day of every week"" simply means every time they gather for worship.    i think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements is that the nt authors assumed that their readers knew when christian worship was.",15,soc.religion.christian

"well 48 bit colour *could* be for improved resolution but 16 bits per channel seems like a bit excessive. i have seen a paper that quoted 10 bits per channel of 12 bits for computational precision. more than that would seem to be wasted.  perhaps the frame buffer uses another colourspace which needs more bits to represent the full range - rgb is a cube so it is a compact encoding.  most likely however is that there are two separate 24 bit (8 bits per component) frame buffers. this set up, called double buffering, allows a complex 3d picture to be built up on one buffer while the other buffer (containing the previous frame) is displayed. this makes for smoother animation.   well hey if you want to brag about numbers, the 5000 range can take a pxg turbo+ card with 96 bits per pixel. full double buffering (two 24 bit buffers), a 24 bit z buffer and an extra 24 bit buffer for off screen image storage.  mind you the card costs more than your workstation.  -- chris lilley ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- technical author, itti computer graphics and visualisation training project computer graphics unit, manchester computing centre, oxford road,  manchester, uk.  m13 9pl                        internet: c.c.lilley@mcc.ac.uk  voice: +44 (0)61 275 6045  fax: +44 (0)61 275 6040 janet: c.c.lilley@uk.ac.mcc",1,comp.graphics

"one thing that i haven't seen in this thread is a discussion of the relation between ibd inflammation and the profile of ingested fatty acids (fas).  i was diagnosed last may w/crohn's of the terminal ileum. when i got out of the hospital i read up on it a bit, and came across several studies investigating the role of epa (an essentially fa) in reducing inflammation. the evidence was mixed. [many of these studies are discussed in ""inflammatory bowel disease,"" macdermott, stenson. 1992.]  but if i recall correctly, there were some methodological bones to be picked with the studies (both the ones w/pos. and w/neg. results). in the studies patients were given epa (a few grams/day for most of the studies), but, if i recall correctly, there was no restriction of the _other_ fas that the patients could consume. from the informed layperson's perspective, this seems mistaken. if lots of n-6 fas are consumed along with the epa, then the ratio of ""bad"" prostanoid products to ""good"" prostanoid products could still be fairly ""bad."" isn't this ratio the issue?  what's the view of the gastro. community on epa these days? epa supplements, along with a fairly severe restriction of other fas appear to have helped me significantly (though it could just be the low absolute amount of fat i eat -- 8-10% calories).",13,sci.med
"superficially a good answer, but it isn't that simple.  an awful lot of the starvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic policies of the western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical westerner.  for instance, some third-world countries with terrible malnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can be fed to cattle in the us, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  they have to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans we encouraged them to take out.  fund-raising for ethiopia is a truly bizarre idea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they've got.  perhaps it's more accurate to say that there's a western ethic against western infanticide.  all the evidence suggests that so long as the children are dying in the third world, we couldn't give a shit.  and that goes for the supposed ""pro-life"" movement, too.  they could save far more lives by fighting against third world debt than they will by fighting against abortion.  hell, if they're only interested in fetuses, they could save more of those by fighting for human rights in china.  and besides, suzanne's answer implies that non-western countries lack this ethic against infanticide.  apart from china, with its policy of mandatory forced abortion in tibet, i don't believe this to be the case.",19,talk.religion.misc

"vera shanti noyes writes;   of course i believe in predestination.  it's a very biblical doctrine as romans 8.28-30 shows (among other passages).  furthermore, the church has always taught predestination, from the very beginning.  but to say that i believe in predestination does not mean i do not believe in free will.  men freely choose the course of their life, which is also affected by the grace of god.  however, unlike the calvinists and jansenists, i hold that grace is resistable, otherwise you end up with the idiocy of denying the universal saving will of god (1 timothy 2.4).  for god must give enough grace to all to be saved.  but only the elect, who he foreknew, are predestined and receive the grace of final perserverance, which guarantees heaven.  this does not mean that those without that grace can't be saved, it just means that god foreknew their obstinacy and chose not to give it to them, knowing they would not need it, as they had freely chosen hell. 							  ^^^^^^^^^^^ people who are saved are saved by the grace of god, and not by their own effort, for it was god who disposed them to himself, and predestined them to become saints.  but those who perish in everlasting fire perish because they hardened their heart and chose to perish.  thus, they were deserving of god;s punishment, as they had rejected their creator, and sinned against the working of the holy spirit.   well, i would hold that as god most certainly gives everybody some blessing for what good they have done (even if it was only a little), for those he can't bless in the next life, he blesses in this one.  and those he will not punish in the next life, will be chastised in this one or in purgatory for their sins.  every sin incurs some temporal punishment, thus, god will punish it unless satisfaction is made for it (cf. 2 samuel 12.13-14, david's sin of adultery and murder were forgiven, but he was still punished with the death of his child.)  and i need not point out the idea of punishment because of god's judgement is quite prevelant in the bible.  sodom and gommorrah, moses barred from the holy land, the slaughter of the cannanites, annias and saphira, jerusalem in 70 ad, etc.  not a >good parallel, but i'm going to go with it anyway), why should we not >stop the murder and violation of people who may (or may not) be more  we should stop the slaughter of the innocent (cf proverbs 24.11-12), but does that mean that christians should support a war in bosnia with the u.s. or even the u.n. involved?  i do not think so, but i am an isolationist, and disagree with foreign adventures in general.  but in the case of bosnia, i frankly see no excuse for us getting militarily involved, it would not be a ""just war.""  ""blessed"" after all, ""are the peacemakers"" was what our lord said, not the interventionists.  our actions in bosnia must be for peace, and not for a war which is unrelated to anything to justify it for us.",15,soc.religion.christian

"the white house                     office of the press secretary  --------------------------------------------------------------- for immediate release                             april 23, 1993                         background information:                      advancing u.s. relations          with russia and the other new independent states                            april 23, 1993   at the vancouver summit, president clinton and president yeltsin  agreed to pursue a number of measures designed to implement an  economic and strategic partnership between the u.s. and russia.   since then, president clinton has directed that a number of steps  be taken to move this process forward.  the administration is  announcing a number of steps today in order to underscore its  deep commitment to a new and closer partnership with russia based  on its government's commitment to reform.   executive review of cold war laws  president clinton and president yeltsin discussed the  desirability of reviewing and updating u.s. laws and regulations  to reflect the end of the cold war.  congress has already acted  to revise many laws to reflect the fact that a communist soviet  union has been replaced by a democratic russia and other  independent states.  however, many laws and regulations remain  that contain language and restrictions that fail to reflect the  end of the cold war and that unnecessarily undermine relations  with russia and the other new independent states.  the president today has ordered an executive review of laws and  regulations so that, where appropriate and consistent with u.s.  security and other national interests, such provisions can be  revised or removed.  he has asked ambassador-at-large strobe  talbott to coordinate this review on an expedited basis.  the  president has indicated that he will welcome congressional  efforts to help this review proceed as quickly as possible.  this review will weigh all considerations that pertain to  revision of such provisions, and the initiation of the review may  help to remedy some of the circumstances that have justified such  provisions in the past.  for example, because the russians are  eager to have their status changed under the jackson-vanik  legislation, president yeltsin personally assured president  clinton in vancouver that he would look into individual cases  involving continuing restrictions on emigration from russia.  by  addressing such issues, this review can help strengthen the bonds  of trust and partnership between the u.s. and russia, and between the u.s. and the other new independent states.   review of cocom  it is also time to consider expeditiously with america's allies  the future of another cold war institution -- the coordinating  committee for multilateral export controls (cocom).  the united  states has begun a thorough review of how to reorient export  controls to the post-cold war world, in which russia is no longer  viewed as a potential adversary, but as a potential ally in  combatting the proliferation of sensitive technology.  steps to improve the security relationship  the president also has taken steps to move ahead on a range of  efforts discussed in vancouver that can strengthen u.s. security  and improve our security relationship with the russians and the  other states.   accelerated deactivation of nuclear weapons  in vancouver, the two presidents discussed accelerating the  process of deactivating nuclear strategic systems scheduled for  elimination under the start i treaty.  president clinton has  directed the department of defense to complete this process well  in advance of the seven year reduction period outlined in start  i.  in addition, the united states, together with russia and the  other relevant states of the former soviet union, will be  exploring programs under nunn-lugar to help them to accelerate  this process.   multilateral test ban  the two presidents agreed at vancouver that negotiations on a  multilateral nuclear test ban should commence at an early date,  and that the two governments would consult with each other  accordingly.  the united states looks forward to beginning  consultations with russia, our allies, and other states, on the  specific issues related to this negotiation.  the united states  expects to start this consultative process within the next two  months.       detargeting  the two presidents also began a dialogue on the issue of nuclear  targeting at vancouver.  as the united states and russia move  into a new relationship of strategic partnership, there is a need  to reexamine many of the assumptions and means employed in the  past to safeguard u.s. security against a nuclear adversary.  the  administration is beginning a comprehensive review of measures  that could enhance strategic stability, including recent  proposals for detargeting nuclear missiles.     other measures to create a new security relationship  in response to the incident involving a collision between us and  russian submarines last month, secretary aspin will be ready to  discuss ways to avoid such incidents in the future with russian  defense minister grachev during his visit to the united states in  late may.  secretary aspin will also be prepared to move forward with  defense minister grachev in may to develop a combined training  program between our two military forces and to prepare for joint  exercises in peacekeeping, such as that authorized by the un  security council.  the united states looks forward to broadening  such training and exercises to include other peacekeeping  contributors, in order to improve inter-operability, readiness,  and planning for multilateral peacekeeping operations.  the us  and russia are working together to convene a may ministerial  meeting of the un security council to discuss proposals for  enhancing the un's peacekeeping capability and to move  consideration of the secretary-general's agenda for peace from  the discussion to the implementation phase.  the u.s. is also  working with the russians to focus specifically on improvements  in the financing and management of un operations.  the purpose of  these initiatives will be to cooperate on peacekeeping for our  participation in un or csce sponsored actions.   multilateral and bilateral partnership with reform  finally, the administration continues to move ahead on a range of  initiatives aimed at striking a partnership with economic and  political reformers throughout russia and the other states.  the  administration is continuing work with our g-7 partners to  assemble the package of multilateral assistance that secretaries  bentsen and christopher recently negotiated in tokyo.  and the  administration is continuing consultation with congress over the  further efforts the u.s. will take to assist the process of  reform in russia and the other states.                             *    *    *  the administration believes these steps can increase american  security while improving the relationship between the u.s. and  russia, and between the u.s. and the other new independent  states.",18,talk.politics.misc

""the notes give them their authenticity,"" said robert wolfe, a supervisory archivist for captured german records.  ""he was supposed to destroy them.  like a lot of bosses, he didn't obey his own rules."" 	the documents, moved out of berlin to what himmler hoped would be a safe hiding place, were recovered by allied forces after world war ii from a salt mine near salzburg, austria. 	himmler spoke on oct.4, 1943, in posen, poland, to more than 100 german secret police generals.  ""i also want to talk to you, quite frankly, on a very grave matter.  among ourselves it should be mentioned quite frankly, and yet we will never speak of it publicly. i mean the clearing out of the jew, the extermination of the jewish race.  this is a page of glory in our history which has never been written and is never to be written.""  [emphasis mine--rje] 	the german word himmler uses that is translated as ""extermination"" is *ausrottung*. 	wolfe said a more precise translation would be ""extirpation"" or ""tearing up by the roots."" 	in his handwritten notes, himmler used a euphemism, ""judenevakuierung"" or ""evacuation of the jews.""  but archives officials said ""extermination"" is the word he actually spoke--preserved on an audiotape in the archives. 	himmler, who oversaw adolf hitler's ""final solution of the jewish question,"" committed suicide after he was arrested in 1945. 	the national archives exhibit, on display through may 16, is a preview of the opening of the united states holocaust memorial museum here on april 26. 	the national archives exhibit includes a page each of himmler's handwritten notes, a typed transcript from the speech and an offical translation made for the nuremberg war crimes trials.  	---from p.a10 of saturday's l.a. times, 4/17/93 	(associated press)",17,talk.politics.mideast

"you apparently think you are some sort of one-man judge and jury who can declare ""total"" victory and then sit back and enjoy the applause.  but you've picked the wrong topic if you think a few rigged ""quotations"" can sustain the legend and lie of the deir yassin ""massacre.""  you have a lot to learn when it comes to historical methodology. at the most basic level, you should know that there is a big difference between weighing evidence fairly and merely finding ""quotations"" that support your preset opinions.  if you have studied the history of israel at all you must know that many of the sources of your ""quotations"" have an axe to grind, and therefore you must be very careful about whom you ""quote.""  for example, meir pa'il, whom you cite, was indeed a general, a scholar, and a war hero.  but that doesn't mean everything that comes out of his mouth is gold.  in fact (and here your lack of experience shows), pa'il is such a fanatic, embittered leftist that much of his anti-israel blathering (forget about anti-irgun blathering) would be considered something like treason in non-israel contexts.  but of course you don't consider this at all when you find a juicy ""quotation"" that you can use to attack israel.  benny morris (of hashomer hatzair) represents himself as a ""scholar"" when he rehashes the old attacks on the irgun.  don't be fooled. it's just the old zionist ideological catfight, surfacing as an attack on the (then-) likud government.  if you will look closely at the section on deir yassin in his book on the war of independence, you will see his ""indictment"" to be pure hot air.  and this is the best he can do after decades of digging for any sort of damning evidence.  unfortunately for him, because his book parades itself as ""scholarly,"" he is forced to put footnotes.  so you can clearly see that his deir yassin account is based on nothing.  the deir yassin ""massacre"" never took place as the propagandists tell it, any more than the sabra and shatila ""massacres."" do you get the feeling people like to blame the jews for ""massacres,"" even if they have to make them up?  it must sound spicy.  even some jews like to do it, for reasons of their own.  please, don't confuse any of you deir yassin ""massacre"" stuff with facts or scholarship.  you should stick to begin's version unless you find something serious to contradict it.",17,talk.politics.mideast

"all of the arguments concerning the sabbath ought to make the point pretty clear - anyone outside of the catholic or orthodox oranglican or monophysite churches ourght to worship on saturday if they are really sola scriptura.  otherwise, they are following a law put into effect by the church, and only the above chruches really recognize any power of the chruch to do so.  andy byler  [you will note that nothing in the faq said anything about the church establishing or changing a law.  the argument against the sabbath is that it is part of the ceremonial law, and like the rest of the ceremonial law is not binding on christians.  this argument is based on paul's letters, acts, and in a more general sense, jesus' teachings.  further, most people argue that scripture shows worship occuring on sunday, and paul endorsing it.  i understand that these points are disputed, and do not want to go around the dispute one more time.  the point i'm making here is not that these arguments are right, but that the backing they claim is scripture.  accepting the principle of ""sola scriptura"" does not commit us to obeying the entire jewish law.  acts 15 and paul's letters are quite clear on that.  i think even the sda's accept it.  the disagreement is on where the bible would have us place the line.  by the way, protestants do give authority to the church, in matters that are not dictated by god.  that's why churches are free to determine their own liturgies, church polity, etc.  if you accept that the sabbath is not binding on christians, then the day of worship falls into the category of items on which individual christians or (since worship is by its nature a group activity) churches are free to decide.",15,soc.religion.christian

"are most players who come up young always good when they're young, or later?   damn.  i was afraid you would say that!   well, perhaps if the braves had no one else worth playing this year it would be lopez in there.  but they do have others worth playing, at least in *their* opinion.  and i happen to agree.   i can believe that.  i'm a newbie here, so i'll take your word.  but alomar *is* a fine defensive catcher, which was my statement above. that is a solid reason for bringing him up at a tender age, as long as they feel he can also hit a bit.  lopez does not have such a consensus about his defensive prowess, and imho that is enough to give him that dreaded ""seasoning"".   sorry.  new.  don't know nichols' law.  don't believe in catchers' era.  but i am interested in pitchers' eras with different catchers. any info on that?   in other words, we know more than they do, so the only logic behind  a different decision than we would make must be financial.  i presume we feel this way about other franchises than atlanta, no?   well if it does make organizational sense, one can hardly fault them for their decisions.  i mean, please don't tell me how to run my business.  especially when i'm being successful.   i'm sure you could be right.  you could also be smoking some illegal substance.

"the ""so sacred it's secret"" explanation is a bit misleading.  while there is a profound reverence for the temple endowment, there is no injunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public.  but since public discussion is often irreverent, most mormons would rather keep silent than have a cherished practice maligned.  but there are certain elements of the ceremony which participants explicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the ceremony itself.   there are other interpretations to christian history in this matter. one must recall that most of what we know about the gnostics was written by their enemies.  eusebius claims that jesus imparted secret information to peter, james, and john after his resurrection, and that those apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the twelve (eusebius, _historia ecclesiastica_ ii 1:3-4).  irenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests and bishops (_against heresies_ iv 33:8), but eusebius disagrees.  he claims the secret ceremonies of the christian church perished with the apostles.  interestingly enough, eusebius refers to the groups which we today call gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (eusebius, op. cit., iii, 32:7-8).  his gripe was not that thay professed *a* gnosis, but that they had the *wrong* one.  writings dealing with jesus' post-resurrection teachings emphasize secrecy -- not so much a concealment as a policy of not teaching certain things indiscriminately.  in one story, simon magus opens a dialog with peter on the nature of god.  peter's response is ""you seem to me not to know what a father and a god is: but i could tell you both whence souls are, and when and how they were made; but it is not permitted to me now to disclose these things to you"" (_clementine recognitions_ ii, 60).  if any one theme underlies the _recognitions_ it is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught, but can be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached.  now one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways.  i don't intend that everyone interpret christian history as i do, but i believe that evidence exists (favorably interpreted, of course) of early christian rites analogous to those practiced by mormons today.   but if judaism and christianity had such ceremonies, would you expect to read about them in public documents?  one can search the book of mormon and other mormon scripture and find almost no information on temple worship.  yes, you could establish that mormons worship in temples, but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that worship.  on that basis, can we conclude that the bible explains *all* practices which might have taken place, and that absence of such descriptions proves they did not exist?  mormon scholar dr. hugh nibley offers us a list of scriptures from which i have taken a few:  1. ""it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given"" (matt. 13:11).  2. ""all men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given"" (matt. 19:11).  3. ""i have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now"" (john 16:12).  4. ""the time cometh, when i shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but i shall shew you plainly of the father"" (john 16:25).  5. ""... unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter"" (1 cor. 3:1-2).  6. ""many things ... i would not write with paper and ink; but i ... come unto you and speak face to face"" (2 jn. 1:12).  (nibley, _since cumorah_, pp. 92-94)  again, these can also be interpreted many different ways.  i believe they serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught were actually taught openly.   historically, joseph smith had been adiministering the temple endowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the freemasons. there is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did not change after smith became a mason.  it can be argued that smith had ample exposure to masonic proceedings through the burlesque of his time and through his brother hyrum (a mason), though no specific connection has yet been established.  my conversations with masons (with respect to temple rite transcriptions which have appeared on the net) have led me to believe that the connection from masonry to mormonism is fairly tenuous.  as our moderator notes, most of what was similar was removed in the recent revisions to the temple ceremony.  i believe that critics who charge that mormon rites were lifted from freemasonry do not have adequate knowledge of the rites in question. --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------          jay windley  *  university of utah  *  salt lake city                     jwindley@asylum.cs.utah.edu",15,soc.religion.christian

"wrong about what?   i think they are correct in thinking that a  well-placed bomb or six would get headlines, but i think they are  wrong if they think that you can set off bombs and still be a  buddhist.  maybe what we are seeing here is that chinese cultural genocide against the tibetans has worked well enough that some tibetans  are now no longer buddhist and are instead willing to behave like the chinese occupiers.   every action is its own reward.   on the other hand, people who are aware of the occupation are mostly full of admiration for the peaceful way that tibetans have put up with it.   and what does it cost us to admire them?   zip.   yes they are, and whether this serves them well or not depends on  whether they want buddhist principles or political independence. and without political independence can they preserve their cultural and religious traditions?   the chinese would certainly refer to them as terrorists, just as the hitler regime used to refer to european resistance movements as terrorists.   better off in what way?   as proponents of pacifism or as  proponents of political autonomy?  and better off in what time-scale?   the soviet empire practised cultural genocide against something like a hundred small minorities, some of which resisted violently, and some of which did not, but in the end it was the soviet empire that collapsed and at least some of the minorities survived.  now some of the minorities are fighting one another.    is that because they have to, or because violent resistance to an oppressive empire legitimized violence?",19,talk.religion.misc

"there is a cartridge capping upgrade for older deskjet printers available from hewlett-packard.  older original deskjet and possibly deskjet 500 units may have a black plastic slide with rubber capping components in the cartrige parking area on the right side (viewed from front) of the printer.  newer printers have a gray or white plastic slide.  the black plastic slide can allow your cartridge to dry out.  there was and may still be information packaged with ink cartridges explaining the situation.  hp placed a coupon for a free upgrade kit to modernize old deskjets to the new capping mechanism.  i did this on my printer and did indeed find that the cartidges now last longer.  i don't have the information handy.  i suggest contacting your nearest hp service center for information on obtaining the kit.  hp has upgrade kits that consist of electronics and mechanical components that vary depending on the starting level printer and the level to which you wish to upgrade.  i upgraded my original desket to a dekjet 500.  the kit was fairly expensive.  you are likely better off selling your old printer and purchasing a new deskjet 500 now that prices have declined so much.  upgrading an original deskjet to 500 requires a fair amount of skill, but no soldering.  upgrading a deskjet plus to a 500 is involves swapping the processor card and changing a few minor parts.  contact your hp service center for further information.  the pcl language used by deskjets is considerably different from the pcl used by laser printers, especially the newer laser printers.  the biggest problem is dumb laser drivers that send a raster end command after each scan line.  this makes no material difference for lasers, but causes the deskjet to print the accumulated raster.  as you might guess, the result is hideously slow printing.  the new dos wordperfect print deskjet drivers are still guilty of this particular behavior.  from the way wordperfect works, this would not be easy to change.  windows wordperfect works efficiently unless you use the dos drivers instead of windows'.  the pcl4 dialect used in the laserjet iiip allows compression that permits a full page 300 dpi image to be rendered with only one megabyte of memory.  an uncompressed image could be as large as about 909 kbytes, but the printer needs about 300k of memory for its internal house-keeping.  laserjet iv models support banded printing that allows incrmental download of the image with compression in limited memory situations.  deskjet downloadable fonts are not compatible with laserjet fonts.  a single page from a laserjet only requires about 20 seconds.  this is faster than any but the most trivial printing from a deskjet printer.  the presumption, of course, being that the laser printer has completed its warm-up cyle.  until ink chemistry is changed, wicking resulting in image deterioration is unavoidable.  i won't use the word impossible, but matching laser quality output from a deskjet printer is unlikely. chosing an appropriate paper type helps, but does not eliminate the problem.  laser printers are more wastful of energy and consumable components.  hp does accept return of spent toner cartridges, mitigating the material waste problem to a degree.  energy waste could use more work.  warm-up times have decreased, allowing stand-by current consumption to be significantly reduced in the laserjet iv.  kyocera produces a laser print engine that employs an amorphous silicon imaging drum with a replacable toner system.  the image drum is good for approximately 100k copies.  it is a very nice print engine.  i wish hp used the kyocera engine.  kyocera also has a neat modular paper source and stacker system.  the recommended duty cycle for a deskjet is significantly lower than any of hp's laser printers.  the pick-up pressure rollers are subject to wear and i case confirm eventually do wear out.  the usual symptom is that the printer becomes reluctant to feed paper. the paper feed is integrated in a transport mechanism that is a single part from hp service.  replacement cost for the transport is almost $200.  the feed rollers are not separately replacable, though it would not be a difficult job for a competent technician. i have disassembled and reassembled the transport on my own printer.  it depends upon the application which printer is best for you.  if you only print 5 or 10 pages a day and are satisfied with the appearance of output, the deskjet is a very good choice.  as noted, the deskjet 500 is my choice for personal use.",12,sci.electronics

"why should anyone (check: let's restrict this to christians, why do *we*) want to find ""commandments"" in the books regarded as scripture?  what's going on? i will pass on psychologizing answers (whether dismissive or more open) as not the kind of issue to deal with here -- the question is what is the *theological* point involved?  and it has been quoted ""at"" me often enough by those who don't believe i take it seriously, that jesus (is said to have) said, ""if you love me, you will obey my commands.""  [john 14:15]  i am, like any christian, the slave of christ, and it is my will that i should do as he wills me to do.  i am (also, or instead) his younger brother, but still under his direction, though we both call god ""abba.""  christians, therefore, will try to find what it is that their lord commands them, and discovering it will feel obligated to do it, or to confess their failure. readers here may set aside the theologizing jargon (such as ""slaves of christ"") -- the point is that adherents of a religion *will* read the texts (whether classified as ""inspired"" or not) that are held up as models, in an effort to find application to their own situations.  this practice ranges from ""devotional"" reading of sermons and the like to the exegesis of canon- ical scripture as ""the word of god.""  and at the highest pitch, this leads to a question of whether we *can* find in inspired scripture something that can act as ""absolute"" guidance for our actions.  the problem is in finding out just *what* it is our lord commands.  i am going to set aside for this essay one major direction in which christians have looked for these commands, namely christian tradition.  that is not because *i* reject tradition, but because my primary audience in this essay is protestants, who deny tradition a determinative value, in favor of the witness of scripture.  the question i want to deal with is, what commandments can we find from our lord in scripture?  and that turns out to be a hard question.  [ if any of my protestant inquisitors would *like* to turn the discussion to the authority of tradition, i can accomodate them :-), unlike *most* protestants, episcopalians admit claims from a) scripture b) reason and c) tradition on roughly equal standing. ]  earlier in john than my quote above, we read [john 13:34] ""i give you a new  commandment: love one another.""  this is the only place in the nt where christians are given an explicit commandment, with the context commenting on its imperative mode pronouncement by jesus.  at the same meal [so we *readers* infer, since it is *not* in john, but in the synoptics] jesus says, ""take this [bread]; this is my body.""  [mark 14:22, cf. matthew 26:26, luke 22:19, 1 corinthians 11:24]  the mode is imperative (greek _labete_), and hence this, too, is a ""commandment.""  in *both* cases we have to *infer* that the command is directed to a wider circle than the immediate collocation of disciples -- because we judge the evangelist's point in mentioning it (with the disciples by then mostly or entirely dead) is that *we* are expected to follow this as a commandment from our lord.  in the case of communion, paul's mention (at least; this is probably true of the evangelists also) implies an ongoing ritual liturgy in which these words operate to ""bind"" christians to the original command to his disciples, as a continuing commandment to the christian community.  i am entirely comfortable with this inference, but i *must* point out that it is there, between us and the occasion on which jesus spoke the command. i take it as a clear inference, at the very least the evangelist's notion, that *all* christians are called to love one another, in jesus' command directed at the disciples.  but i have to call attention to the inference. the command cannot apply to me without the generalization from the specific context of its statement to my own context as a ""disciple"" of christ.  all reading of scripture has to make such inferences, to get any sense out of the text whatsoever.  this is a general problem in reading these texts -- we cannot read them at all without our *own* understanding of our native languages in which we (normally) read the (translated) texts, and without *some* appreciation of the original context (and at points, the original languages, when english misleads us.) i am going to presume, in what follows, that we have the *general* problem of how to read scripture under control [ i don't *really* think this is true, but it will suffice for my current purposes. ]  i will address only the issues that arise when we have already coped with the understanding of a 2000 year old text from another world than the one we live in.  questions at that level only introduce more reser- vations about the commandments issue than will be found stipulating that we can read the texts as the original audience might have done.  among the reasons we have for seeing john's _agapate allelou_ as a *general* commandment (not merely an instruction by jesus to this disciples on that one occasion), and one linking it to the synoptic ""great commandment"" is that we have criticism, from jesus, about limiting our love to those whom we congenially associate with.  in matthew 5:43ff we read, ""you have learnt say to you: love your enemies.""  in fact, the leviticus context quoted does not say 'hate your enemy' -- it is merely the common human presumption. (and leviticus is at pains to say that the ""love"" should extend to strangers amongst the people of israel.)  luke, in expanding on this same q context, goes on to have jesus say. ""even sinners love those who love them."" [6:27] all of this suggests [quite strongly, i'd say :-)] that *limiting* the scope of the ""new commandment"" is not quite what jesus has in mind.  in short, inference *leads me* to generalizing the actual text to a command that is ""in force"" on christians, and with objects not limited to other christians.  trickier than the _agapate allelou_ or institution of communion, there is the case of the ""great commission"" where (matthew 10, mark 6) the twelve are sent out to evangelize, ""proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand.""  the verb is imperative (_ke:russete_), but the context is rather specific to the twelve, and there are further specifiers (as in ""do not turn your steps to pagan territory, and do not enter any samaritan town"" -- the lukan parallels are even more specific to jesus' final journey to jerusalem) which make it harder to see this generalizing to all christians than the previous examples.  that hasn't prevented christians from making such an inference; what i have to call attention to is that such inference is not justified in the text, nor (unlike the first two cases i cite) by the rhetoric of the evangelist urged on the reader.  still, paul seems to have felt obliged to ""proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand"" even (contrary to jesus' instructions to the 12 :-)) to the gentiles, to the ends of the earth.  so, christians after him have also taken this as a ""commandment"" in the sense of john 14:15.  do i ""accept"" this?  i don't know.  it is surely rather speculative.  but you see how the ripples of inference spread out from the text that is the pretext -- christians (may) infer a general commandment, applicable to all, from what is presented in the gospels as a specific occasion.  i do not (necessarily) object to this kind of generalization -- but i *insist* that people who make it *must* have an understanding that they are *reasoning* (at some considerable length) from what we actually *have* in scripture.  there are *assumptions* involved in this reasoning, and *these* are *not* themselves scriptural (though people will do their best to ""justify"" their assumptions by other references to scripture -- which simply adds more inference into the mix!)  let's move on to the ""great commandment"" -- that we should love god with our whole hearts and minds and souls.  this is, perhaps, the synoptic ""equivalent"" of john's _agapate allelou_.  and yet,  it is not presented as a commandment, in our texts.  rather, the context is controversy with the pharisees.  to cite matthew [22:34ff]  	""but when the pharisees heard that he had silenced the sadducees 	they got together and, to disconcert him, one of them put a question, 	""master, which is the greatest commandment of the law?""  it is by no means obvious here (though i accept it as such) that jesus' answer is meant to be a commandment *to christians*.  he is answering a polemic from his enemies.  [ mark's account, in  12:28-34 casts the answer in a far more positive light as (so the ""scribe"" in this version says) ""far more important than any holocaust (i need to point out that this word originates in the context of animal sacrifice; forget the nazis for this) or sacrifice.""  luke is intermediate -- he has a lawyer posing the question ""to disconcert"" jesus, and gets the good samarian parable for his pains [ luke 10:25-37 ].  the contexts here are so confusingly various that one could be forgiven for drawing *no* inferences :-)  in *no* account is this said as if it were obviously to be taken as a commandment binding on christians -- though i think it an entirely reasonable conclusion in each case that jesus thinks it to be so.  the point is that our mental gears have to grind a cycle or so to get to any conclusion from all of this about what we are commanded to do, by jesus.  and all of this is contingent on our understanding the point of jesus' use of the torah in the (all quite different) gospel accounts, and the application of such a context to *us*.  the different contexts among the synoptics are curious.  it should be noted that only in luke do we get the ""fixing"" of this command by the parable of the good samaritan.  we may look for an analogous *intent* in matthew, where 7:12 gives the ""golden rule"" as ""the meaning of the law and the prophets"" (and where we may also hear an echo of hillel saying the same, a generation before jesus.)  if we make these associations (which i think are entirely reasonable), we are -- again -- indulging in inference.  the texts do not *explicitly* support us; rather, we *read* the texts as having this kind of inter-relationship.  current literary theory calls this ""intertextuality.""  my discussion of why the _agapate allelou_ ""has"" to apply beyond the  community of the disciples, and beyound the circle of christian believers, applies again here, to buttress a conclusion that this *is* (despite the presentation not saying so explicitly) a ""commandment"" to christians. few christians would disagree with my conclusions -- but i *must* point out that they *are* conclusions, they *depend* on rather elaborate chains of reasoning that are simply not present in the texts, themselves.  the contextual problem keeps coming up, more and more severely as we look at those sayings of jesus that are not so universally taken by christians as  commandments.  and we get some really hard cases.  take divorce.  mark is  pretty clear, ""the man who divorces his wife and marries another is guilty of adultery against her.""  [ 10:11, cf. luke 16:18 ] -- except that matthew has an escape clause [ ""except in the case of fornication"", 5:31 ]. this seems to be a rather clear ""commandment"" (whether or not we take matthew's reservation); and some christians, to this day, take it so.  but some don't, at least in practice.  this is rather peculiar; it is not as if jesus were not explicit about this (whereas he says nothing at all about some of the things people gnash their teeth over.)  how is it possible, if the commands of christ are clear, that matthew can so disagree with the other evangelists of the synoptic tradition?  i'm going to continue this examination, into ever-murkier waters, but this is enough to start with.  the theme is: ""finding commandments in scripture is an exercise in inference; our inferences are informed by our assumptions, that is, our own cultural biases.""  i have, so far, identified a very few ""commandments"" that are generally accepted by all christians -- and yet in these, already, some of the difficulties start to surface.  it is these difficulties i want to discuss in my next essay on this topic.  the divorce commandment already strikes at some of the difficulties: i see almost no evidence that the people who are so eager to find commandments to condemn *me* with, spend any time at all writing nasty screeds to soc.couples or misc.legal about the horrors or viciousness of divorce, or demanding that us law refuse to allow it, or refuse ""unrepentant divorcees"" places in their churches.  [ that is not to say that divorce *doesn't* enter into  consideration in general -- it is most definitely a matter of concern, in even the most ""liberal"" church circles.  for example, a (wildly) liberal episcopalian priest of my aqauintence, in a (wildly) liberal diocese, has recommended to a couple who approached him to marry them that they have a ""private"" secular ceremony before a judge, so that the ""public"" ceremony he celebrated need not go through an agonizing ""examination"" by officials who would just as soon not take on this role of interpreting the commands we are faced with as christians.  this, in a church that was effectively created by a famous divorce! ]",19,talk.religion.misc

"if i get a chance i will ask them this weekend.                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  the words i have underlined are at the heart of the problem. a ""quick look"" doesn't do justice to the depth of the book of jeremiah. having studied the jeremiah/ezekial period solidly for over a year at one stage of my life, i have to say that there is a great deal of underlying theological meaning in the judgement prophesies. let me make one point. the clash between jeremiah and the ""false prophets"" was primarily in the theological realm. the ""false prophets"" understood their relatioship to god to be based on the covenant that the lord made with david. it is possible to trace within the pages of the old testament who this covenant, which was initially conditional on the continued obedience of david's descendants, came to be viewed as an unconditional promise on the part of the lord to keep a descendant of david's upon the throne and to never allow jerusalem to subjegated by any foreign power. jeremiah was not a judahite prophet. he was from anathoth, across the border in what had formerly been israelite territory. when he came to prophesy, he came from the theological background of the covenant the lord had made with israel through moses. the northern kingdom had rejected the davidic covenant after the death of solomon. his theology clashed with the theology of the local prophets. it was out of a very deep understanding of the mosaic covenant and an actute awareness of international events that jeremiah spoke his prophesies. the ""judgement prophesies"" were deeply loaded with theological meaning.  in my opinion, both the portland earthquake prophesy and the david wilkerson ""new york will burn"" prophesy are froth and bubble compared to the majestic theological depths of the jeremiah prophesies.  --                                                                      ___ bill rea                                                            (o o) -------------------------------------------------------------------w--u--w---",15,soc.religion.christian

"ok, with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with quicktime, the effects of scaling and so on, i thought i'd do some more tests.  first of all, i felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than realistic. the movie i had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a version of the very first movie i created with the compact video compressor). i decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results (for better or for worse).  i pulled out a copy of ""2001: a space odyssey"" that i had recorded off tv a while back. about fifteen minutes into the movie, there's a sequence where the earth shuttle is approaching the space station. specifically, i digitized a portion of about 30 seconds' duration, zooming in on the rotating space station. i figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between frames. to increase the differences between frames, i digitized it at only 5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.  i captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the spigot card in my centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a pal source). i then imported it into premiere and put it through the compact video compressor, keeping the 5 fps frame rate. i created two versions of the movie: one scaled to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. i used the default ""2.00"" quality setting in premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten frames.  i then ran the 320*240 movie through the same ""raw speed test"" program i used for the results i'd been reporting earlier.  result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.  that's right, i was getting a much higher result than with that first short test movie. just for fun, i copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard disk (a quantum lp105s), and ran it from there. this time the playback rate was only about 35 frames per second. obviously the 230mb internal hard disk (also a quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.  i modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240 size. this time the playback speed was over 60 fps. clearly, the poster who observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing quicktime 1.0 in action, not 1.5. i'd try my tests with quicktime 1.0, but i don't think it's entirely compatible with my centris and system 7.1...  unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.  the other thing i tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with ""preferred"" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played from within movieplayer (ie with quicktime's normal synchronized playback). a preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn't work too well: the playback was very jerky. compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with ease. i can't believe that quicktime's synchronization code would add this much overhead: i think the slowdown was coming from the mac system's task switching.  a preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: i couldn't see any evidence of stutter. at 8.0 (=> 40 fps) i *think* i could see slight stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.  i guess i could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. of course, this will also improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance even more...",1,comp.graphics

"point 1:  i'm beginning to see that *part* of the disagreements about the whole ""yeast issue"" is on differing perceptions and on differing meanings of words.  medical doctors have a very specific and specialized ""jargon"", necessary for precise communication within their field (which i'm fully cognizant of since i, too, speak ""jargonese"" when with my peers).  for the situation in sci.med, many times the words or phrases used by doctors can have a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in the world at large, causing significant miscommunication.  one example word, and very relevant to the yeast discussion, is the exact meaning of ""systemic"". it is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific, much more so than its meaning to a non-doctor.  there is also the observation of this newsgroup that both doctors and non-doctors come together on essentially equal terms, which, when combined with the jargon issue, can further fan the flames.  this is probably the first time that practicing doctors get really ""beat up"" by non-doctors for their views on medicine, which they otherwise don't see much of in their practice except for the occasional ""difficult"" patient.  point 2:  i understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will not prescribe any treatments/therapies for their patients unless such treatments have been shown to be effective and the risks understood from well-constructed clinical trials (usually double-blind), or that such treatments/therapies are part of an approved and funded clinical trial.  to these doctors, to do any differently would, in this belief system, be unethical practice.  and it follows that any therapy not on the ""accepted"" list is therefore a non- therapy - it does not even exist, nor does the underlying hypothesis or theory have any validity, even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolation of what is currently known.  anecdotal evidence has no value, either, from a treatment point-of-view.  and by and large, as a scientist myself, i am glad that medical practice/ science takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment.  however, as also being a human being (last i checked), and having been one of those people that has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment, where ""standard"" medicine was not able to help me, has caused me to sit back and wonder if holding such an extreme and rigid ""scientific"" viewpoint is in itself unethical from humanitarian considerations.  after all, the underlying intent of the ""scientific"" approach to medicine is to protect the health of the patient by providing the best possible care for the patient, so the patient should come first when considering treatment.  what we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies both the ""scientific"" and the ""humanitarian"" viewpoints.  in an earlier post i outlined a crazy idea for doing just that.  the gist of it was to give any physician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribe alternate, not yet proven therapies (maybe supported by anecdotal evidence) for patients who *all* avenues of accepted therapies have been exhausted (and not until then).  the patient would be fully informed that such therapies/treatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and that there are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derived from them.  this approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor.  it also satisfies the humanitarian needs of the patient.  and the reality is that many patients who have reached a dead-end in the treatment of their symptoms using accepted medicine *will* go outside the orthodox medical community:  either to the doctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losing their license, or worse, to non-doctors who have not had the proper medical training.  this approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the control more within orthodox medicine, with the benefits that the information gleaned could help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the most productive way.  everybody wins in this admittedly rose-colored approach - i'm sure there are real problems with this approach as well - it is presented more as a strawman to stimulate discussion.  hopefully what i write here may give the sci.med doctors a better idea as to why i am ""open"" to alternative therapies, as well as why i have real difficulty (read ""apparent hostility"") with the ""coldness"" of the 99.9% pure ""scientific"" approach to medicine.  i believe the best approach to medical treatment is one where both the ""humanitarian"" aspects are balanced with and by the ""scientific"" aspects.  anything else is just not good medicine, imho. just my 'nf' leanings, i guess.  :^)  comments?  jon noring  --   charter member --->>>  infj club.",13,sci.med

": >why not build a inflatable space dock.  : if you're doing large-scale satellite servicing, being able to do it in : a pressurized hangar makes considerable sense.  the question is whether : anyone is going to be doing large-scale satellite servicing in the near : future, to the point of justifying development of such a thing.  that's a mighty fine idea.  but since you asked ""why not,"" i'll respond.  putting aside the application of such a space dock, there are other factors to consider than just pressurized volume.  temperature control is difficult in space, and your inflatable hangar will have to  incorporate thermal insulation (maybe a double-walled inflatable). micrometeoroid protection and radiation protection are also required. don't think this will be a clear plastic bubble; it's more likely to look like a big white ball made out of the same kind of multi-layer fabric that soft-torso space suits are made out of today.  because almost all manned space vessels (skylab, mir, salyut) used their pressurization for increased structural rigidity, even though they had (have) metal skins, they still kind of qualify as inflatable.  the inflation process would have to be carefully controlled.  the space environment reduces ductility in exposed materials (due to temperature extremes, monotomic oxygen impingement, and radiation effects on materials), so your ""fabric"" may not retain any flexibility for long.  (this may not matter.)  even after inflation, pressure changes in the hangar may cause flexing in the fabric, which could lead to holes and tears as ductility decreases.  these are some of the technical difficulties which the llnl proposal for an inflatable space station dealt with to varying degrees of success.  -- ken jenks, nasa/jsc/gm2, space shuttle program office       kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov  (713) 483-4368",14,sci.space
"well, i've provided examples to show that the trend was general, and you (or others) have provided some counterexamples, mostly ones surrounding mating practices, etc.  i don't think that these few cases are enough to disprove the general trend of natural morality.  and, again, the mating practices need to be reexamined...   no, but mating practices are a special case.  i'll have to think about it some more.   indeed.  but, while the natural system is objective, all objective systems are not the natural one.  so, the terms can not be equated.  the natural system is a subset of the objective ones.   i don't claim that homosexuality is immoral.  it isn't harmful, although it isn't helpful either (to the mating process).  and, when you say that homosexuality is observed in the animal kingdom, don't you mean ""bisexuality?""   this is standard jargon.  read any textbook.  the ""we"" forms are used throughout.   that's right.  the goals themselves aren't inherent.   you could, but such would contradict observations.   but a postulate is something that is generally (or always) found to be true.  i don't think your postulate would be valid.   yes, and i think the goals of survival and happiness *do* work.  you think they don't?  or are they not good goals?",0,alt.atheism

"hello there.  the other day i was feeling a tad nostalgic and thought about constructing an old-time crytal radio set.  i figured on substituting a modern germanium diode for the crystal, and winding the antenna coil, etc., myself.  the only problem i seem to have is in locating a source for a tuning capacitor -- you know, the old meshed-plate variable condensers which used to be the mainstay for tuning circuits.  well these things seem to be all but extinct in their original catalog habitats.  trimmer capacitors are relatively abundant, but are not really suitable for this application.  so, can anyone point me to a supplier of tuning capacitors in the  0--360 pf range?  manythanks.  --",12,sci.electronics

"i have a '71 buick skylark with 148k on it.  i bought it in california, and if it'll let me, i'd like to keep it for another year.  the only problem is these indiana winters--my heater controls don't work.  the car has vacuum operated control switches for the vents.  right now it is stuck in the ""vent"" mode.  it will blow warm air, but i can't switch the air flow to either the floor (i can live without this) or the defrost (i can't  live without this).  i probably could just jam the air deflector to the  defrost position, but this blows a lot of air in my face and is, well, kind of like putting a vacuum cleaner in reverse.  i have taken parts of the dash off and looked at the vacuum system and i think the problem (or part of it) is with the two diaphragms which control up/down and outside/inside air flow.  the diaphragm which controls outside(vent)/in- side(no vent) air is cracked most of the way around, and the other one is probably damaged too, considering the advanced age of the car.  two questions:  	1)  is there anything i should be aware of about this (other than 	the fact that i should move from indiana) ?  	2)  in the event that replacement diaphragms aren't available, is there 	a way to ""fix"" this?  thanks for any advice/info  selah,",7,rec.autos

"i was at an interesting seminar at work (uk's r.a.l. space science dept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale solar sail proposed as a student space project. the guy giving the talk was keen to generate interest in the project. i'll typein the handout he gave out at the meeting. here goes :   			the microlight solar sail 			-------------------------  1. introduction the solar sail is a well-established concept. harnessing the pressure of sunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. in principle, such a vehicle could explore the whole solar system with zero fuel consumption.  however it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most people realize. the pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per square kilometer. deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized fabric which would be necessary to transport a 'conventional' type spacecraft is a daunting task. this is why, despite the potential of hte idea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.  2.design recent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: a tiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely be electronics, with no mechanical parts. several attitude control methods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a panel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.  the key components of the craft will be a minute ccd camera developed at edinburgh university which can act as both attitude sensor and data gathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and communication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface of the sail itself. launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost of the mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.  3.missions the craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. for example: a) it could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the apollo or amor groups. closeup pictures could be transmitted back to earth at a low bit rate. b) it could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. previously unobserved areas around the lunar poles could be viewed. by angling the sail to reflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive sunlight could be imaged. bright reflections would confirm that volatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these locations.[immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar base, btw] c) it could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet nucleus. impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craft causes it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edged tube, like performing a biopsy. returning to earth, the sail acts as an ideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heat is reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300 deg c. the material sample is recovered, enclosed in a small insulating container.  contact: colin jack                              tel. 0865-200447 oxford mathematical designs, 131 high street, oxford ox1 4dh, england  --------------------------------  this guy would love to hear from anyone interested in this project or seeking details or anything, and would be most happy to send you more information.  	andy    --",14,sci.space

"i have a question that is a slight variation on the previously mentioned examples that perhaps people could give me some pointers on (it has been a couple of years since my con law class in college so i hope i am not missing something obvious here...)  basic scenario:  	i set up a bbs that uses public-key encryption and encryption of 	files on disk.  the general setup is designed so that when users  	connect they send a private key encrypted using the system public 	key and the user's public-private keypair is used to wrap the 	one-time session keys used for encrypting the files on disk.  the 	result of this is that even if i reveal the system private key it 	is impossible for anyone to gain access to the files stored on the 	machine.  what is possible is for someone to use the revealed 	system private key to entice users into revealing thier personal 	private keys during the authentication sequence.  questions:  	does the fact that the system private key does not provide any 	information useful for a search give me any protection as far as 	being coerced to reveal the key?  (i doubt it myself..)  	it seems providing the system private key does not mean that i am 	assisting in ""entrapment"" (the users would send thier key anyway 	and are not being enticed into doing something they would not 	otherwise do) but is there any other hook that can be used?  	would the user private-key enticement require wiretap approval?  any answers or general musings on the subject would be appreciated...  jim",11,sci.crypt

"was going over some videos last night.....  studying 1986 and 1992 videotapes of jose canseco proved to be very interesting.  and enlightening.  here's my analysis of jose canseco, circa sep '92, and jose canseco, circa june 1986.  1.  he's bulked up too much.  period.  he needs to lose about 20 pounds,     not gain more bulk.  2.  his bat speed has absolutely vanished.  conservatively, i'd say he's     lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that's a huge amount of speed.  3.  that open stance is killing him.   note that he acts sort of like     brian downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is     released.  downing could do this without significant head movement -     canseco can't.  also, note that canseco doesn't always close his     stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,     they're fully closed.  without a good starting point, it's hard     to make adjustments in your swing.  what would i do, if i were jose?  aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that i could never touch, so that i'd never have to work again, i'd restructure my entire swing.  first, minimize movement before the swing.  close and widen the stance, and severely cut down the stride i take on my swing.  hopefully, this will cut down on the time i need to swing, and will allow me to move the bathead more freely.  second, drop 20 pounds.  cut out the weight work.  third, relax the wrists.  will cost some power, but until i can find my 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rolling the wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives.  his strength  is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of the park.  if canseco's open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back problems, he'll be out of baseball in three years.  if not, he could still hit 600+ hr.",9,rec.sport.baseball

"when will people learn!  the trouble is the ballast in the concrete and as every fool knows ballast  resistors are used to discharge batteries. furthermore it is very silly to  store the battery with the terminals downwards as you must have done to  contact the ballast.   seriously: self discharge (the actual problem, as stated by others) does vary  greatly with certain types and freaks show low self discharge. i have in  fact seen ordinary automotive batteries which have effectively held full  charge for > 2 years so it must be possible.  if your garage is heated, store the batteries somewhere cooler but above  freezing (flat batteries freeze more easily). occasionally charge it (once a  month?) or even leave it on 'float' charge permanently (special charger,  don't do this unless you know what you are doing, seriously dangerous).  anouther point is the unsuitability of automotive batteries for things like  electric mowers -- they are not generally designed to be repeatedly deep  discharged and their life may be greatly shorted. some early zero maintenance  automotive batteries in fact responded to a full discharge with total failure  shortly afterwards but modern ones are superb.

"------- blind-carbon-copy  to: spacenews@austen.rand.org, cti@austen.rand.org subject: white house outlines options for station, russian cooperation date: tue, 06 apr 93 16:00:21 pdt from: richard buenneke <buenneke@austen.rand.org>  4/06/93:  gibbons outlines space station redesign guidance  nasa headquarters, washington, d.c. april 6, 1993  release:  93-64          dr.  john h.  gibbons, director, office of science and technology policy, outlined to the members-designate of the advisory committee on the redesign of the space station on april 3, three budget options as guidance to the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space station.          a low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a high option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  each option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development, operations, utilization, shuttle integration, facilities, research operations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.          over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the nasa budget for the president's new technology investment.  as a result, station options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in the rest of the nasa budget.  for example, a space station option of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the nasa budget over the next 5 years.          gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of the advisory committee.  generally, the members-designate focused upon administrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  they also received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the station redesign team is following to develop options for the advisory committee to consider.          gibbons also announced that the united states and its international partners -- the europeans, japanese and canadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give ""full consideration"" to use of russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.          to that end, the russians will be asked to participate in the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign team can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of mir and the possible use of mir and other russian capabilities and systems. the u.s. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of the russian participants in assessing russian systems and technology.  the overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes. careful integration of russian assets could be a key factor in achieving that goal.          gibbons reiterated that, ""president clinton is committed to the redesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the science, the technology and the jobs that the space station program represents.  however, he also is committed to a space station that is well managed and one that does not consume the national resources which should be used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.""          nasa administrator daniel s.  goldin said the russian participation will be accomplished through the east-west space science center at the university of maryland under the leadership of roald sagdeev.",14,sci.space

"let's look at the effects of inflation on 1930's superstars' salaries.  i read once that the babe made $80,000 one year and that was about as good  as it got for him.  let's assume he made that in 1928 (i'm not sure of the figures, but i know i'm in the ballpark--pun intended). :-)  today, assuming a 4% yearly inflation rate, which is an understatement if not accurate, his measly $80,000 salary would be worth.  fv = $80,000 x (1+4%)^(1993-1928)    = $80,000 x (1.04)^65    = just over $1,000,000.  assuming inflation is average of around 5%.  fv = $80,000 x (1+5%)^65    = almost 2,000,000.  (i didn't crunch these numbers beforehand).  these numbers might lead one to believe that today's players are slightly  overpaid.  the babe appears to have made then what today's average to above average players make now.  perfectly accurate salary, year of salary, and  average inflation rate would make this analysis more accurate, but i don`t  think i'm off by much.  chop chop  michael mule'",9,rec.sport.baseball

"i don't know the first thing about yeast infections but i am a scientist. no scientist would take your statement --- ""no convincing empirical evidence to support the existence of systemic yeast syndrome"" --- to tell you anything except an absence of data on the question.  noring has pointed out the catch-22 that if the ""crazy"" theory were true, you probably couldn't find any direct evidence of it --- that you couldn't observe those yeastie beasties with present methods even if they were there.  noring and the fellow from oklahoma (sorry, forgot your name) have also suggested one set of anecdotal evidence in favor based on their personal experiences --- namely, that when people with certain conditions are given anti-fungals, many of them appear to get better.    so, if you have any evidence *against* the hypothesis --- for example, controlled double-blind studies showing that the anti-fungals don't do any better than sugar water --- then let's hear it.  if you don't, then what we have is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side, and abject disbelief on the other.  in which case, please, there is no point in yelling back and forth at each other any longer since neither side has any convincing evidence either positive or negative.    and i understand that your abject disbelief is based on the existence of people who may get famous or make money applying the diagnosis to everything in sight, making wild claims with no evidence, and always refusing to do controlled studies.  but that has absolutely no bearing on the apparently sincere experiences of the people on the net observing anti-fungals working on themselves and other people in certain specific cases.  there are also quacks who sell oral superoxide dismutase, in spite of the fact that it's completely broken down in the guts, but this doesn't change the genuine scientific knowledge about the role of superoxide dismutase in fighting oxidative damage.  same thing.  just cause there are candida quacks, that doesn't establish evidence against the candida hypothesis.  if there's some other reason (besides the quacks), if only anecdotal, to think it could be true, then that is what has to be considered, that is what the net people have been talking about.  but again, there is no point in arguing about it.  there is anecdotal evidence, and there is no convincing evidence, and there are also some candida quacks out there, i hope everyone can agree on all of that.  thus, it appears to me the main question now is whether the proponents can marshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convincing and documented enough manner to make a good case for carrying out a good controlled double-blind study of antifungals (or else, forget convincing anybody else to carry out the test, just carry it out themselves!) --- and also, whether they can adequately define the patient population or symptoms on which such a study should be carried out to provide a fair test of the hypothesis.  ken",13,sci.med

"we developed a toolkit running on the x window system. the toolkit copes with any languages based on x11r5's i18n facility. as you know, there are 2 kinds of i18n implementation from mit's  x11r5 release -- xsi and ximp. our original implementation of the toolkit uses xsi.  our toolkit manages each character's size based on our own font management system. in order to do that, the 'wchar_t' typed character strings must be decomposed to character sets. this means that if one wchar_t type compound string with  ascii and kanji mixed, for example, is given, each element of the wchar_t array must be checked its corresponding character set based on a bit layout and application environment's locale. in this case if the locale is 'japanese', each wchar_t character will be classified either to iso8859-1, jisx0208 or so.  we need a function to do this. the function must check how many characters from the top are the same character set and what the character set is.  we could not find any public x11r5 function to do that and inevitably, used xsi's internal functions to construct that function. the following is the source code of that function 'decomposecharacterset()'.   //i18n.h // this may look like c code, but it is really -*- c++ -*- // $id: i18n.h,v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:24 iima exp iima $  #ifndef _i18n_h #define _i18n_h  #include <x11/xlib.h>  extern int decomposecharacterset(const wchar_t *wc_str,	/* in */ 				 int wc_len,		/* in */ 				 char *buf,		/* out */ 				 int *buflen,		/* in/out */ 				 int *scanned_len,	/* out */ 				 char **charset);	/* out */ extern xmstring wchartoxmstring(const wchar_t *wc_str); extern xmstringcharset charsetofwchar(const wchar_t wc);  #endif /* _i18n_h */  //i18n.cc /* $id: i18n.cc,v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:05 iima exp $ */  #include <stdlib.h> #include <x11/xlibint.h> #include <xm/xm.h> #include ""i18n.h""  extern ""c"" { #include <x11/wchar.h> #define _xwcdecomposeglyphcharset xxx_xwcdecomposeglyphcharset #define _xmbfscs xxx_xmbfscs #define _xmbctidtocsid xxx_xmbctidtocsid #include ""xlocaleint.h"" #undef _xwcdecomposeglyphcharset #undef _xmbfscs #undef _xmbctidtocsid     extern int _xwcdecomposeglyphcharset(xlocale, const wchar_t*, int, 					 char*, int*, int*, int*);     extern charset *_xmbfscs(xlocale, _csid);     extern _csid _xmbctidtocsid(xlocale, _csid); };  int decomposecharacterset(const wchar_t *wc_str,/* in */ 			  int wc_len,		/* in */ 			  char *buf,		/* out */ 			  int *buf_len,		/* in/out */ 			  int *scanned_len,	/* out */ 			  char **charset)	/* out */ {     xlocale xlocale = _xfallbackconvert();     int ctid;     int status;     charset *xcharset;          status = _xwcdecomposeglyphcharset(xlocale, wc_str, wc_len, buf, 				       buf_len, scanned_len, &ctid);     if (status == success) { 	xcharset = _xmbfscs(xlocale, _xmbctidtocsid(xlocale, ctid)); 	*charset = (xcharset) ? xcharset->cs_name : null;     }     else 	*charset = null;     return status; } ----------------  an included file above, ""xlocaleint.h"", is also xsi internal and we copied the file to the toolkit directory and compiled.  a serious issue occured when we tried to compile a toolkit application on our hp machine with its os version of hp-ux9.01.  when we tried to link an application based on our toolkit, link errors occured saying that the following functions are missing:     _xmbctidtocsid (code)     _xmbfscs (code)     _xwcdecomposeglyphcharset (code)     _xfallbackconvert (code)  we had used mit release version of x11r5 and its xsi implementation until hp-up9.0 and ran applications successfully. one of the reasons to use xsi was that because hp did not release hp's x11r5 until the os 9.0 and we had no way to  know how hp's r5 would be implemented. we had hoped xsi's popularity and used  its internal functions.   the hp's linker complains that there are no xsi internal functions implemented. we observe from hp's libx11.a, they used some ximp implementation but we are not sure if they used mit's vanilla ximp version or their own version of ximp and therefore, finding just counter part functions in mit's ximp for xsi does not seem to lead us a solution.  my question and goal is to know how we can construct a function like 'decomposecharacterset()' listed above. is there any function to check character set of each element of wchar_t type strings depending on locales? if it is a public function, that is perfect but even if it is not, we want to use any internal functions in hp's x11r5 as we did for mit's r5.  in order to render a 'wchar_t' type string, there must be some machinery to judge character sets and that is how the proper fonts are selected for the string. we have no way to find out that without any hp's x11r5 source  files. we want to know how we can use that for our goal.  any help or comments would be highly appreciated.  i also appreciate if anyone tell me about ximp treating around this area even if it is not hp's implementation.  thank you.",5,comp.windows.x

""the doors of our camps are always open to  armenian freedom fighters,"" he affirmed.  among the prominent greek politicians who attended the conference was the son of prime minister papandreou, who himself holds a post in the greek cabinet; two members of the cypriot parliament who had journeyed to athens for the specific purpose of attending the international gathering; representatives of the christian democratic party, edik center party, two wings of the communist party, representatives of an assortment of labor unions and trade associations, a number of mayors of greek towns and cities; two greek members of the european parliament and other members of the greek parliament were also among those who participated in the international conference. also on hand to follow the deliberations was the ambassador of bulgaria in athens.  more than significant was the large number of messages received by the  organizers, including the following: palestinian national revolutionary movement, fatah; popular front for the liberation of palestine-general command; the central committee of the palestinian national liberation movement-fatah; the socialist progressive party of lebanon; arab socialist labor party; the kurdistan democratic union of iraq; and numerous other international groups, all noted for their radical stand in the israeli- palestinian conflict.                   support from arf-rm  among messages received from armenian groups was the armenian revolutionary federation-revolutionary movement, the group that has claimed the abduction and assassination of key party leaders in lebanon accused of selling out to foreign interests and powers. the message clearly gave its support to the armenian popular movement pledging that the revolutionary movement will continue to ""reveal the realities, no matter how bitter or tragic they are,"" to expose the anti-armenian activities of the leaders of the dashnag ""bureau."" the message was taken as an indication of the link, loose as it may be, that exists between the dissident dashnag group and the armenian popular movement, open supporters of asala and armed struggle.  the armenian popular movement has set up its headquarters in a suburb of the greek capital, known as neos kosmos, where there is a large armenian presence. the headquarters are located in a two-story building, which appears to have turned into a beehive of activity on the part of scores of armenian youth, who prefer to give their first names only when invited to introduce themselves...  now any comment?  #from: vd8@cunixb.cc.columbia.edu (vedat  dogan) #subject: re:addressing..... #message-id: <1993apr8.233029.29094@news.columbia.edu>      n>crap posted by mr.

"what??!!!!  you can't remove it, unless you register?   you gotta be joking, right? what happens if i get a demo-version of that program, install it, and then decide that i don't like it.  do i have to register to be able to get rid of it?  (hell, no, that is the last thing i would think of!) if that is what you mean, then you would better make pretty sure, that a statement to that effect is printed loud and clear on the package!   a better way to implement the above mentioned scheme is (imho) to allow anyone to install the program, but if they register, they get some additional features enabled.  it could mean only one new .exe file needed to be copied, to have got the full-version of the program. of course anyone is _free_ to _delete_ or _remove_ that program at whatever time they like.  still, we face the trouble of 'moving' the new .exe file around.  that could be solved by having the user registering him self, and get back a specially marked for him (or her) a new .exe file.   as for some sort of limitations, here are some suggestions: limit the size of data that the program can work with, disable saving the data, print it out with some defects in the output (but be sure to mark them as such) let some pop-up screen appear for ca. 10 secs. when the program is started and/or exited  etc.... but don't have it that you _must_ register to be able to remove it.",12,sci.electronics

"right.  most definitely.   this may be the root of the confusion...  please consider the following hypothetical with an open mind.  note that i am *not* (yet) saying that it has anything to do with the question at hand.  suppose we have a simplified lotto game.  you pick a number from 1-10 and win if that number is drawn.  suppose we have a large population of people who play this game every week.  in the first year of the game, approximately 1/4 of the population will win 7 or more times.  in the second year of the game, 1/4 of those 7-time winners will again be 7-time winners.  in the third year of the game, 1/4 of those who won 7 or more times in each of the first two years will win 7 again.  suppose i started with 1024 people in my population.  after three years, i have 32 people who have consistently, in each of the last three years, won 140% or more the number of times expected.  do we expect them to be big winners in the fourth year of the game? no.  because we know there is no skill involved.  nothing about these ""consistent winners"" can influence their chances of winning.  but suppose we *don't* know whether or not there is a chance that skill might be involved.  perhaps some of the people in our population are psychic, or something.  how would we test this hypothesis?  we can look for correlations in the population.  now most of the population will show zero correlation.  but our psychics should show a high positive correlation (even if they aren't very good psychics, they should still manage to win 7 or more times most years).  net result?  a small positive correlation over the entire population.   well, zero correlation is zero correlation.  you mention that sabo has hit poorly in the clutch over the last 3(?) years.  but if we look at the past, we find that clutch patterns are just as likely to reverse as they are to remain consistent.  the length of the streak doesn't seem to make a difference to the probability that the player will be clutch or choke the next year.  is there any reason to expect *this* streak to be different from past streaks?  now if it were true that ""75% of all three-year streaks remained true to form"", then we might have something useful.  but then we wouldn't have zero correlation.  instead we have ""50% of all three-year streaks remain true to form, and 50% of all three-year streaks reverse"".  you look at those numbers and say ""three year choke streak implies more likely to choke this year"".  but it would be equally valid to look at those numbers and say ""three year choke streak implies more likely to be clutch this year"", since the probabilities are split 50-50 each way.   then we would have something useful.  and we would also have a positive correlation.  but for every individual that exhibits such a pattern and holds true, there is another who exhibits such a pattern and then reverses.",9,rec.sport.baseball
"oh contrer mon captitan!  there is a way.  certainly it is not by human reason.  certainly it is not by human experience. (and yet it is both!)  to paraphrase sartre, the particular is absurd unless it has an infinite reference point.  it is only because of god's own revelation that we can be absolute about a thing.  your logic comes to fruition in relativism.    ah, now it is clear.  ludwig was a desciple of russell. ludwig's fame is often explained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements in contemporary philosophy. both revolve around tractatus logico-philosphicus ('21) and philosophical investigation ('53).  many of witt's comments and implicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique of language he offers.  according to some of the implicit suggestions of witt's thought, ordinary language is an invaluable resource, offering a necessary framework for the conduct of daily life.  however, though its formal features remain the same, its content does not and it is always capable of being transcended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened, giving us a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say.  on witt's own account, there is a dynamic fluidity of language.   it is for this reason that any critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language to talking about its boundaries, where a boundary is understood not as a wall but a threshold.   vonwrights's comment that witt's ""sentences have a content that often lies deep beneath the surface of language.""  on the surface, witt talks of the insuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringing ourselves to accept it without question.  at the same time, we are faced with witt's own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes in our traditional modes of understanding.  philosophy, then, through more perspicacious speech, seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it is already functioning. yes?  the most brilliant of scientists are unable to offer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject christianity! in his tractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasse of the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of reality by man.  perfect language does not exist for fallen man, therefore we must get on about our buisness of relating truth via ordinary language.    this is why john's gospel is so dear to most christians.  it is so simple in it conveyance of the revealation of god, yet so full of unlieing depth of understanding.  he viewed christ from the ot concept of ""as a man thinketh, so he is.""  john looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside, that is the consciousness of christ.  and so must we.  words are only vehicals of truth.  he is truth.  the scriptures are plain in their expounding that there is a truth and that it is knowable.  there are absolutes, and they too are knowable.  however, they are only knowable when he reveals them to the individual.  there is, and we shouldn't shy from this, a mysticism to christianity.  paul in rom 8 says there are 3 men in the world.  there is the one who does not have the spirit and therefore can not know the things of the spirit (the spirit of truth) and there is the one who has the spirit and has the capacity to know of the truth, but there  is the third.  the one who not only has the spirit, but that the spirit has him! who can know the deep things of god and reveal them to us other than the spirit.  and it is only the deep things of god that are absolute and true.    there is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be experienced and it is verifiable.  i disagree with dr nancy's sweetie's conclusion because if it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.

"gosh, i wish people would read the postings that they are 'following up' to.   the original poster (w g wright) posted an item saying that he had bought a new wizz-bang laser printer from apple (a select 300 i think) which can print grayscale. he then said that he cannot print grayscale from his se computer (and also that all the 'experts' he has dealt with agree that it is not possible).  this is the one major bugbear about doing a 3rd party se upgrade (compared to apple's se to se/30 upgrade): you will never be able to run color quickdraw. it is color quickdraw that controls color and grayscale.  ses can print some colour: this is because quickdraw - the original, non-colour version, has the right hooks for eight colours. some of you will remember the 'scsigraph' solution to getting a colour screen for your se (i think that it gave you sixteen colours by dithering or something).  there is no reason that apple couldn't release software patches for older computers (there are lots of mac pluses, classics and ses that have been upgraded to 68020 and 68030 processors which should be perfectly able to deal with color quickdraw) - but they wont, and 3rd parties are having a difficult  time in duplicating the mac's roms (i.e. nutek et al.).  just one caveat: i would have thought that if you were printing a postscript grayscale image onto a postscript grayscale printer, that you would be able to do so, whatever mac you were using.

"here is some material by michael davies on the subject of schism in general and archishop lefebvre in particular.  he wrote it around 1990.  the first part of the two-part article was on the scandalous activities of archbishop weakland (in this country), but i cut all that.  and i pared down the rest to what was relevant.  joe buehler  ...  schism and disobedience  according to st. thomas aquinas, schism consists primarily in a refusal of submission to the pope or communion with the members of the church united to him. on first sight it would appear that, whatever the subjective motivation of the archbishop, as discussed above, he must be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to the pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power of jurisdiction. however, standard catholic textbooks of theology make it clear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of disobedience are schismatic. if this were so, as was noted at the beginning of this article, it would mean that the number of american bishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures.  the distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in the article on schism in the very authoritative dictionnaire de theologie catholique. the article is by father yves congar who is certainly no friend of archbishop lefebvre.  he explains that schism and disobedience are so similar that they are often confused. father congar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence of legitimate authority in the church, for example, luther's rejection of the papacy. father congar explains that the refusal to accept a decision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not constitute schism but disobedience.  the catholic encyclopedia explains that for a catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to intend ""to sever himself from the church as far as in him lies.""  it adds that ""not every disobedience is schism; in order to possess this character it must include besides the transgression of the command of the superiors, a denial of their divine right to command.""not only does mgr. lefebvre not deny the divine right of the pope to command, but he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the pope's authority and his intention of never breaking away from rome. the archbishop made his attitude clear in the july/august 1989 issue of 30 days: ""we pray for the pope every day. nothing has changed with the consecrations last june 30. we are not sedevacantists. we recognize in john paul ii the legitimate pope of the catholic church. we don't even say that he is a heretical pope. we only say that his modernist actions favor heresy.""  ...  intrinsically schismatic?  the principal argument used by those claiming that mgr. lefebvre is in schism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate is an intrinsically schismatic act. a bishop who carries out such a consecration, it is claimed, becomes ipso facto a schismatic. this is not true. if such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act it would always have involved the penalty of excommunication. in the 1917 code of canon law the offence was punished only by suspension (see canon 2370 of the 1917 code). pope pius xii had raised the penalty to excommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismatic church in china. the consecration of these illicit chinese bishops differed radically from the consecrations carried out by mgr. lefebvre as the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the pope, that is, to deny that he has the right to govern the church, and the illicitly consecrated chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercise an apostolic mission. neither archbishop lefebvre nor any of the bishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of jurisdiction. they have been consecrated solely for the purpose of ensuring the survival of the society by carrying out ordinations and also to perform confirmations. i do not wish to minimize in any way the gravity of the step take by mgr. lefebvre. the consecration of bishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than the ordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of the primacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the roman pontiff. but the archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the church could not be more grave, and that grave measures were needed in response.  it appears to be taken for granted by most of the archbishop's critics that he was excommunicated for the offense of schism, and the vatican has certainly been guilty of fostering this impression.  there is not so much as a modicum of truth in this allegation. the new code of canon law includes a section beginning with canon 1364 entitled ""penalties for specific offenses"" (de poenis in singula dicta). the first part deals with ""offenses against religion and the unity of the church"" (de delictis contra religionem et ecclesiae unitatem). canon 1364 deals with the offense of schism which is, evidently, together with apostasy and heresy, one of the three fundamental offenses against the unity of the church.  but the archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this canon or, indeed, under any canon involving an offense against religion or the unity of the church. the canon cited in his excommunication comes from the third section of ""penalties for specific offenses"" which is entitled ""usurpation of ecclesial functions and offenses in their exercise"" (de munerum ecclesiasticorum usurpatione degue delictis iniis exercendis). the canon in question is canon 1382, which reads: ""a bishop who consecrates someone bishop and the person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without a pontifical mandate incur an automatic (latae sententiae) excommunication reserved to the holy see.""  the scandalous attempts to smear archbishop lefebvre with the offense of schism are, then, contrary to both truth and charity. a comparable smear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly justify legal action for libel involving massive damages. an accurate parallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter had been convicted of first degree murder.  i must stress that what i have written here is not the dubious opinion of laymen unversed in the intricacies of canon law. canon lawyers without the least shred of sympathy for mgr. lefebvre have repudiated the charge of schism made against him as totally untenable. father patrick yaldrini, dean of the faculty of canon law of the institut catholique in paris noted in the 4 july 1988 issue of valeurs actuelles that, as i have just explained, mgr.  lefebvre was not excommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical function. he added that it is not the consecration of a bishop which constitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the illicitly consecrated bishop. it is this usurpation of the powers of the sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing a parallel church.  cardinal rosalio lara, president of the pontifical commission for the authentic interpretation of canon law, commented on the consecrations in the 10 july 1988 issue of la repubblica. it would be hard to      the act of consecrating a bishop (without a papal mandate) is not     in itself a schismatic act. in fact, the code that deals with     offenses is divided into two sections. one deals with offenses     against religion and the unity of the church, and these are     apostasy, schism, and heresy. consecrating a bishop with a     pontifical mandate is, on the contrary, an offense against the     exercise of a specific ministry. for example, in the case of the     consecrations carried out by the vietnamese archbishop ngo dinh     thuc in 1976 and 1983, although the archbishop was excommunicated     he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because     there was no intention of a breach with the church.  ....  it is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating bishops without a papal mandate archbishop lefebvre had the least intent of establishing a schismatic church. he is not a schismatic and will never be a schismatic. the archbishop considers correctly that the the church is undergoing its worst crisis since the arian heresy, and that for the good of the church it was necessary for him to consecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his society. canon law provides for just such a situation, and even if one believes that the future of the society could have been guaranteed without these consecrations, the fact that the archbishop believed sincerely that it could not means, as canon law states clearly, that he has not incurred excommunication. furthermore, while the vatican allows such prelates as archbishop weakland to undermine the faith with impunity it cannot expect catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against a great and orthodox archbishop whose entire life has been devoted to the service of the church and the salvation of souls.  dr. eric m. de saventhem, president of the international una voce association, is one of the best informed laymen in the church, and he knows the archbishop intimately. dr. de saventhem, like myself, has no greater desire than to see a reconciliation between mgr. lefebvre and the holy see during the archbishop's lifetime. a quotation from a statement by dr. de saventhem which was published in the 15 february 1989 remnant merits careful study:",15,soc.religion.christian

"i'd *desparately* prefer it if we didn't rehash the same arguments that went on ad infinitum last time.  that's especially true for sci.crypt.  for that matter, i've created alt.privacy.clipper, since the traffic is appearing in *many* different groups right now.  i'm going to focus here on some technical aspects of the plan, hence my followup to sci.crypt.  frankly, if you're not an absolutist, your feelings may turn on some of these issues.  for example -- with an 80-bit key, simply splitting it into two 40-bit pieces is much less acceptable than other schemes, because it means that if just one repository is, shall we say, overly pliable, a would-be eavesdropper would need to recover just 40 more bits of key.  i need not point out in this newsgroup that that's pretty easy to do by exhaustive search. a slightly more complex scheme -- xor-ing the key with a random number, and then with its complement -- would produce two 80-bit subkeys, neither of which is useful alone.  that variant is much more resistant to attack.  clearly, one can get even more sophisticated, to protect the subkeys even more.  other thoughts...  some people have noted the size and complexity of the databases necessary.  but the id strings the phones emit could be their back door key, double-encrypted with the escrow repositories' public keys.  for that matter, they could do that only with session keys, and have no back door at all.  in that case, the fbi would have to bring every intercept to the repositories to be decrypted.  this would answer many of the objections along the lines of ``how do you make sure they stop''.  we can even combine that with a variant of the digital telephony back door -- have the switch do the tap, but with a digitally-signed record of the time, phone number, etc, of the call.  that provides proof to the escrow agents that the tap was done in compliance with the terms of the warrant.  i can suggest other variations, too.  suppose each clipper chip had 100 public key pairs.  each would be used ~10 times, after which you'd need more keying material.  (not a bad idea in any event.)  this could be used to enforce time limits, or rather, usage limits, on each warrant; the keys the repository agents would deliver wouldn't last for very long.  i suspect that the cryptographic algorithm itself is secure.  apart from the obvious -- why push a weak algorithm when you've already got the back door? -- i think that the government is still genuinely concerned about foreign espionage, especially aimed at commercial targets.  this scheme lets the spooks have their cake and eat it, too.  (i've heard rumors, over the years, that some factions within nsa were unhappy with des because it was too good.  not that they couldn't crack it, but it was much too expensive to do so as easily as they'd want.)  they're keeping the details secret so that others don't build their own implementations without the back door.",11,sci.crypt

"""muslim"" in ex-yugoslavia was a *nation* not a religion.  in fact, not all muslims in b-h are followers of islam.  therefore, there do (did?) exist in ex-yugoslavia ""christian muslims.""  tito defined the muslim  nation constitutionally, adding muslims to serbs, croats, and slovenes, the three founding nations which entered into a voluntary union at the end of wwi.  in addition, tito added two other nations constitutionally: montenegrins, and makedonijans.   nations had the right of secession, but republics did not.  so, ""muslim"" is much more a political term than a religious term (for those who  differentiate between religion and politics, that is) in b-h.  it was not  a ""christo-slavic"" ideology that made a muslim nation in yugoslavia, it was the ""atheist communist"" ideology of tito.  before tito, there was no muslim nation in yugoslavia.    the war is not a religious war, and it is not an ethnic war.  it is a civil war in which the terms of secession are being negotiated with guns instead of pens.  the croat, muslim, and serb political leaders *all* chose to fight over the terms of secession instead of compromising and peacefully negotiating multilateral secession agreements.",17,talk.politics.mideast

"(2nd posting of the question that just doesn't seem to get answered)  suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped window that contains xlib graphics.  a button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item to be drawn in the window.  this action clearly should not call xcopyarea()  (or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles ""regular"" expose events (e.g. window manager-driven exposures) take care of rendering the new image.  using an expose event handler is a ""proper"" way to do this because at the time the handler is called, the xlib window is guaranteed to be mapped.  the problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window is already visible and mapped.  what we need to do is somehow ""tickle"" the window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable it to render *just* the part of the window that contains the new item.",5,comp.windows.x

"(webster:  myth:  ""a traditional or legendary story...            ...a belief...whose truth is accepted uncritically."")  how does that qualify? indeed, it's almost oxymoronic...a rather amusing instance. i've found that most atheists hold almost no atheist-views as ""accepted uncritically,"" especially the few that are legend. many are trying to explain basic truths, as myths do, but they don't meet the other criterions. also...   you accuse him of referencing mythology, then you procede to launch your own xtian mythology.  (this time meeting all the requirements of myth.)   ah, but not everyone ""knows"" that god exists.  so you have a fallacy.   and that makes it true?  holding with the bible rules out controversy? read the faq.  if you've read it, you missed something, so re-read. (not a bad suggestion for anyone...i re-read it just before this.)   ...should i repeat what i wrote above for the sake of getting it across?  you may trust the bible, but your trusting it doesn't make it any more credible to me.  if the bible says that everyone knows, that's clearly reason to doubt the bible, because not everyone ""knows"" your alleged god's alleged existance.   1) no, they don't have to ignore the bible.  the bible is far from universally accepted.  the bible is not a proof of god; it is only a proof that some people have thought that there was a god.  (or does it prove even that?  they might have been writing it as series of fiction short-stories.  as in the case of dionetics.)  assuming the writers believed it, the only thing it could possibly prove is that they believed it. and that's ignoring the problem of whether or not all the interpretations and biblical-philosophers were correct.  2) there are people who have truly never heard of the bible.  3) again, read the faq.   bzzt...wrong answer! gravity is directly there.  it doesn't stop exerting a direct and rationally undeniable influence if you ignore it.  god, on the other hand, doesn't generally show up in the supermarket, except on the tabloids.  god doesn't exert a rationally undeniable influence. gravity is obvious; gods aren't.   no, human reason hasn't always come back to the existance of ""god""; it has usually come back to the existance of ""god"". in other words, it doesn't generally come back to the xtian god, it comes back to whether there is any god.  and, in much of oriental philosophic history, it generally doesn't pop up as the idea of a god so much as the question of what natural forces are and which ones are out there.  from a world-wide view, human nature just makes us wonder how the universe came to be and/or what force(s) are currently in control.  a natural tendancy to believe in ""god"" only exists in religious wishful thinking.   xtianity is no more reasonable than most other religions, and it's reasonableness certainly doesn't merit eminence. divine justice...well, it only seems just to those who already believe in the divinity. first, not all atheists believe the same things about human nature. second, whether most atheists are correct or not, you certainly are not correct on human nature.  you are, at the least, basing your views on a completely eurocentric approach.  try looking at the outside world as well when you attempt to sum up all of humanity.",0,alt.atheism

"<moral driver distinctions deleted>   compare the driver to an urge such as jealousy, where there is an urge and an ""object"". the jealousy does not technically exist until the object is apparent. however, the capacity to be jealous is presumably still there even though it is not detectable.  your description of the unbilical took me three passes to understand (!) but i get the gist and i have to tentatively agree. i think our two definitions can sit side by side without too much trouble, though. i haven't attempted to define the reason behind the moral driver (only hinted through the essence of each moral). your definition hints that animals are also capable of a similar morality - simians have a similar social order to ourselves and it is easy to anthropomorphize with these animals. is this possible or have i misunderstood?   my p.s. thoughts falls roughly in line with john stuart mill and his writings on utilitarianism. i have no particular plan (except to do my bit - personal ethics and social work). my opinion (for what it is worth) is that the authority for each moral must be increased somehow, and that this will probably take several generations to be effective. i don't think that the list of morals has changed for society significantly, though . the authority element may come from our authority figures and roles models (see eric berne and his transactional analysis work [+ mavis klein] for references) and this is what gives rise to a deterioration of moral standards in the long term.  i've had some more thoughts on my definitions:  i've was thinking that i should add moral character to the list of definitions in order to get a dynamic version of the moral nature (ie. the interplay of the moral code and associated authorities). a suitable analogy might be a graphic equaliser on a hifi system - the moral nature being the set of frequencies and the chosen 'amplitudes', and the moral character being the spectrum over time.  conscience is a little more difficult because i can't define it as the reasoning of a person between actions in the context of his moral nature because conscience seems to cut in most of the time unbidden and often unwanted. i think conscience is manifest when a decision is made at a given time which compromises one's moral nature. my conscience fits in more with freud's superego (plus the moral driver) with the stimulous being the urges or freud's id. the reasoning that i mentioned before is freud's ego, i suppose. if the moral driver is part of the id then the reason why conscience cuts in unbidden is partially explained. the question is ""what provides the stimulous to activate the moral driver?"". i think i need some more time with this one.  that's about it for now!  david.  --- on religion:",19,talk.religion.misc

"ensoniq sq-80 cross-wave synthesizer: i have an sq-80 for sale.  the sq-80 is a powerful performance oriented synth with a limited on-board sequencer.  i bought it because it has a very large timbral repertoire;  it seems to do meaty analog synth sounds as well as sounds that are considerably more ""digital"". below are a list of features extracted from the owner's manual:   o eight-voice polyphonic poly-timbral synthesizer, capable of     playing eight different sounds at once, with dynamic stereo     panning for each voice   o voice section employing cross-wave synthesis;  combine different     attack and sustain wave segments to create complex, dynamic sounds   o 75 sampled waves (includes a drumset) serve as the sound source   o dynamic voice allocation:  each sequencer track/midi channel has     access to all eight voices   o a full-featured midi controller keyboard capable of sending eight     midi program and volume changes at once.  keyboard is velocity     sensitive, and transmits/receives velocity and polyphonic aftertouch.   o powerful matrix modulation scheme allows a very wide range of      modulation sources and routings.   o a 3.5"" floppy disk drive which writes/reads ordinary ds/dd disks     allows fast and reliable storage of up to 600 sequences and up to     1728 sound patches on a single floppy disk.  also has a ram-cart slot     for patches that is compatible with esq-1 ram-carts.   o does sysex dumps to its floppy disk for any sysex capable midi device   o 80 character fluorescent display and user-friendly ""page-driven""     programming scheme provides a fairly humane user interface   o stereo line-outs, and stereo headphone jack for private listening   o sound programs and sequences are upwardly compatible with the esq-1     so that sounds and sequences created for the esq-1 can be played on     the sq-80.  this sq-80 has been the main midi controller in my studio for quite a while now.  it has performed ably in that role, and has also been a heavily used sound source at the same time.  the sq-80 seems to have been designed with this role in mind, and it works very well with my software sequencer (wincake) in its multitimbral mode.  short samples (there are 75 of them) as sources, then these waves are processed with a sophisticated dcf-dca arrangement.  the sq-80 is capable of great things because of its 4-pole analog lowpass filter. simply put, it makes fabulous analog synth sounds.  but unlike most good analog synths, it has a very thorough midi implementation so that it works very well with a midi sequencer.  what i really like most about this thing is that it is capable of making a very wide range of sounds. this sq-80 is about 5 years old (mfg. date 1/21/88).  it does have an 8-track sequencer, but like most on-board sequencers, it is a pain to use so i have avoided it.  reason for sale: i am selling my sq-80 because i recently joined forces with another individual here in boston, and we have more keyboards than space to put them.  i recommend it for someone who is getting started in sequencing and needs a powerful but economical master keyboard.  pricing and terms: i paid $1300.00 for this synth a few years ago.  i am willing to accept $650.00 (average r.m.m.s asking price is $733.00).  i will include a bunch of  patches on sq-80 floppy disks for the buyer of this synth, as well as the  original ensoniq sq-80 owner's manual.  price:    asking $650.00 (everything) shipping: split shipping (ups surface cod) anywhere in the lower 48 states ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- craig vanderborgh                                         verbex voice systems e-mail:  craigv@rad.verbex.com                            119 russell street phone: (508) 486-8886                                     littleton, ma 01460",6,misc.forsale

"as a libertarian (with a small l) who voted for clinton, i think that he should abolish the selective service and the draft.  if his conscience forbade him to go to war in vietnam, it should forbid him to perpetuate this system of government-sanctioned slavery.   if our government would pay attention to serious domestic issues (the economy) and choose to stay out of other people's wars (iraq, bosnia, somalia), we would not be in this fix.  an anyway, couldn't the jobs be replaced by improving our domestic situation?

"i will clarify my earlier quote.  god's laws were originally written for  the israelites.  jesus changed that fact by now making the law applicable to all people, not just the jews.  gentiles could be part of the kingdom of heaven through the saving grace of god.  i never said that the law was made obsolete by jesus.  if anything, he clarified the law such as in that quote you made.  in the following verses, jesus takes several portions of the law and expounds upon the law giving clearer meaning to what god intended.  if you'll notice, he also reams into the pharisees for mucking up the law with their own contrived interpretations.  they knew every letter of the law and followed it with their heads but not their hearts.  that is why he points out that our righteousness must surpass that of the pharisees in order to be accepted into the kingdom of heaven.  people such as the pharisees are those who really go out of their way to debate about the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin. they had become legalistic, rule-makers - religious lawyers who practiced the letter of the law but never really believed in it.    i think you will agree with me that there are in today's world, a lot of modern-day pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe in it.  what good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart?  christianity is not just a set of rules; it's a lifestyle that changes one's perspectives and personal conduct.  and it demands obedience to god's will. some people can live by it, but many others cannot or will not.  that is their choice and i have to respect it because god respects it too.  god be with you,",19,talk.religion.misc

(laughter.) 	      	     the president:  i don't really believe that the  situation in bosnia -- it's not been a good week for the world, but i  don't know that the administration could have made it different. 	      	     on the stimulus package, i'd like to put it into the  larger context and remind you that in this 100 days we have already  fundamentally changed the direction of an american government.  we  have abandoned trickle-down economics.  we've abandoned the policies  that brought the debt of this country from $1 trillion to $4 trillion  in only a decade.   	      	     the budget plan, which passed the congress, which will  reduce the deficit and increase investment, has led to a 20-year low  in mortgage rates, dramatically lower interest rates.  there are  probably people in this room who have refinanced their home mortgages  in the last three months, or who have had access to cheaper credit.   that's going to put tens of billion dollars coursing throughout this  economy in ways that are very, very good for the country.  and so we  are moving in the right direction economically. 	      	     i regret that the stimulus did not pass, and i have  begun to ask -- and will continue to ask not only people in the  administration, but people in the congress whether there is something  i could have done differently to pass that.  part of the reason it  didn't pass was politics; part of it was a difference in ideas.   there are really people still who believe that it's not needed.  i  just disagree with that.   	      	     i think the recovery -- the economists say it's been  underway for about two years, and we've still had 16 months of seven- percent unemployment, and all the wealthy countries are having  trouble creating jobs.  so i think there was an idea base -- an  argument there, that while we're waiting for the lower interest rates  and the deficit reduction and the investments of the next four years  to take effect, this sort of supplemental appropriation should go  forward. 	      	     now, i have to tell you, i did misgauge that because a  majority of the republican senators now sitting in the senate voted  for a similar stimulus when ronald reagan was president in 1983, and  voted 28 times for regular supplemental appropriations like this.  i  just misgauged it.  and i hope that i can learn something.  i've just  been here 90 days.  and, you know, i was a governor working with a  contentious legislature for 12 years, and it took me a decade to get  political reform there.  so it takes time  to change things.  but i  basically feel very good about what's happened in the first 100 days  with regard to the congress. 	      	     q	  waco -- 	      	     the president:  well, with regard to waco i don't have  much to add to what i've already said.  i think it is a -- i want the  situation looked into.  i want us to bring in people who have any  insights to bear on that.  i think it's very important that the whole  thing be thoroughly gone over.  but i still maintain what i said from  the beginning, that the offender there was david koresh.  and i do  not think the united states government is responsible for the fact  that a bunch of fanatics decided to kill themselves.  and i'm sorry  that they killed their children. 	      	     q	  mr. president, to follow up partly on helen on your  stimulus package and on your political approach to capitol hill, ross  perot said today that you're playing games with the american people  in your tax policy.  he was strongly critical of your stimulus  package.  he said he's going to launch an advertising campaign  against the north american free trade agreement.  how are you going  to handle his political criticism?  will it complicate your efforts  on the hill with your economic plan?  and do you plan to repackage  some of the things that have been in your stimulus program and try to  resubmit them to the hill? 	      	     the president:  let me answer that question first.   we're going to revisit all of that over the next few days.  i'm going  to be talking to members of congress and to others to see what we can  do about that.  with regard to the economic plan, i must say i found  that rather amazing.  i don't want to get into an argument with mr.  perot.  i'll be interested to hear what his specifics are, but i  would -- go back and read his book and his plan.  there's a  remarkable convergence except that we have more specific budget cuts,  we raise taxes less on the middle class and more on the wealthy.   but, otherwise, the plans are remarkably similar.   	      	     so i think it would be -- i'll be interested to see if  maybe perhaps he's changed his position from his book last year and  he has some new ideas to bring to bear.  i'll be glad to hear them. 	      	     q	  to follow up, sir, how do you plan to handle his  political criticism?  he's launched a campaign against you.  do you  think you can sit back and just -- 	      	     the president:  well, first of all, i will ask you to  apply the same level of scrutiny to him as you do to me.  and if he's  changed his position from the positions he took in the campaign last  year, then we need to know why and what his ideas are.  maybe he's  got some constructive ideas.   	      	     i think the american people have shown that they're very  impatient with people who don't want to produce results.  and the one  thing i think that everybody has figured out about me in the last --  even if they don't agree with what i do -- is that i want to get  something done.  i just came here to try to change things.  i want to  do things.  and i want to do things that help people's lives.  so my  judgment is that if he makes a suggestion that is good, that is  constructive, that takes us beyond some idea i've proposed that will  change people's lives for the better, fine.  but i think that that  ought to be the test that we apply to everyone who weighs into this  debate and not just to the president.  	     q	  mr. president, to go back to bosnia for a minute.   you continue to insist that this has to be multilateral action, a  criteria that seems to have hamstrung us when it comes to many  options thus far and makes it look as if this is a state of  paralysis.  the united states is the last remaining superpower.  why  is it not appropriate in this situation for the united states to act  unilaterally?  	     the president:  well, the united states -- surely you  would agree, that the united states, even as the last remaining  superpower, has to act consistent with international law under some  mandate of the united nations.  	     q	  but you have a mandate and --  	     the president:  they do, and that is one of the things  that we have under review.  i haven't ruled out any option for  action.  i would remind all of you, i have not ruled out any option,  except that we have not discussed and we are not considering the  introduction of american forces into continuing hostilities there.   we are not.    	     so we are reviewing other options.  but i also would  remind you that, to be fair, our allies have had -- the french, the  british and the canadians -- have had troops on the ground there.   they have been justifiably worried about those.  but they have  supported the airdrops, the toughening of the sanctions.  they  welcomed the american delegation now in europe, working on how to  make these sanctions really work and really bite against serbia.  and  i can tell you that the other nations involved are also genuinely  reassessing their position, and i would not rule out the fact that we  can reach an agreement for a concerted action that goes beyond where  we have been.  i don't have any criticism of the british, the french  and others about that. 	      	     q	  would that be military action? 	      	     q	  mr. president, several of the leading lights in  your administration, ranging from your fbi director to your u.n.  ambassador, to your deputy budget director to your health services  secretary, have issued statements in the last couple of weeks which  are absolutely contradictory to some of the positions you've taken in  your administration.  why is that?  are you losing your political  grip? 	      	     the president:  give me an example.  	      	     q	  example?  judge sessions said that there was no  child abuse in waco.  madeleine albright has said in this morning's  newspapers, at least, that she favors air strikes in bosnia.  all of  these are things you said that you didn't support. 	      	     the president:  first of all, i don't know what -- we  know that david koresh had sex with children.  i think that is  undisputed, is it not?  is it not?  does anybody dispute that?  where  i come from that qualifies as child abuse.  and we know that he had  people teaching these kids how to kill themselves.  i think that  qualifies as abuse.  and i'm not criticizing judge sessions because i  don't know exactly what he said. 	      	     in terms of madeleine albright, madeleine albright has  made no public statement at all about air strikes.  there is a press  report that she wrote me a confidential letter in which she expressed  her -- or memo -- in which she expressed her views about the new  direction we should take in response to my request to all the senior  members of my administration to let me know what they thought we  ought to do next.  and i have heard from her and from others about  what they think we ought to do next.  and i'm not going to discuss  the recommendations they made to me, but in the next few days when i  make a decision about what to do, then i will announce what i'm going  to do.  so i wouldn't say that either one of those examples qualifies  speaking out of school. 	      	     q	  how about the value added tax, mr. president? 	      	     the president:  what was that? 	      	     q	  the value added tax -- mrs. rivlin and miss shalala  both said that they thought that that was a good idea. 	      	     the president:  i don't mind them saying they think it's  a good idea.  there are all kinds of arguments for it on policy  grounds.  that does not mean that we have decided to incorporate it  in the health care debate.  no decision has been made on that.  and i  have no objection to their expressing their views on that.  we've had  a lot of people from business and labor come to us saying that they  thought that tax would help make their particular industries more  competitive in the global economy.  i took no -- that wasn't taking a  line against an administration policy. 	      	     q	  mr. president, a week ago a group of gay and  lesbian representatives came out of a meeting with you and expressed  in the most ringing terms, their confidence in your understanding of  them and their political aspirations, and their belief that you would  fulfill those aspirations.  do you feel now that you will be able to  meet their now enhanced expectations? 	      	     the president:  well, i don't know about that.  and i  don't know what their -- it depends on what the expectations are.   but i'll tell you this:  i believe that this country's policies  should be heavily biased in favor of nondiscrimination.  i believe  when you tell people they can't do certain things in this country  that other people can do, there ought to be an overwhelming and  compelling reason for it.  i believe we need the services of all of  our people, and i have said that consistently.  and not as a  political proposition.  the first time this issue came up was in 1991  when i was in boston.  i was just asked the question about it. 	      	     and i might add -- it's interesting that i have been  attacked -- obviously, those who disagree with me here are primarily  coming from the political right in america.  when i was governor, i  was attacked from the other direction for sticking up for the rights  of religious fundamentalists to run their child care centers and to  practice home schooling under appropriate safeguards.  i just have  always had an almost libertarian view that we should try to protect  the rights of american individual citizens to live up to the fullest  of their capacities, and i'm going to stick right with that. 	      	     q	  are you concerned, sir, that you may have generated  expectations on their end and criticism among others that has  hamstrung your administration in the sense of far too great emphasis  on this issue? 	      	     the president:  yes, but i have not placed a great deal  of emphasis on it.  it's gotten a lot of emphasis in other quarters  and in the press.  i've just simply taken my position and tried to  see it through.  and that's what i do.  it doesn't take a lot of my  time as president to say what i believe in and what i intend to do,  and that's what i'll continue to do. 	      	     q	  mr. president, getting back to the situation in  bosnia -- and we understand you haven't made any final decisions on  new options previously considered unacceptable.  but the two most  commonly heard options would be lifting the arms embargo to enable  the bosnian muslims to defend themselves and to initiate some limited  air strikes, perhaps, to cut off supply lines.  without telling us  your decision -- presumably, you haven't made any final decisions on  those two options -- what are the pros and cons that are going  through your mind right now and will weigh heavily on your final  decision?   	      	     the president:  i'm reluctant to get into this.  there  are -- those are two of the options.  there are some other options  that have been considered.  all have pluses and minuses; all have  supporters and opponents within the administration and in the  congress, where, i would remind you, heavy consultations will be  required to embark on any new policy. 	      	     i do believe that on the air strike issue, the  pronouncements that general powell has made generally about military  action, apply there.  if you take action, if the united states takes  action, we must have a clearly-defined objective that can be met.  we  must be able to understand it and its limitations must be clear.  the  united states is not, should not, become involved as a partisan in a  war.   	      	     with regard to the lifting of the arms embargo, the  question obviously there is if you widen the capacity of people to  fight will that help to get a settlement and bring about peace?  will  it lead to more bloodshed?  what kind of reaction can others have  that would undermine the effectiveness of the policy? 	      	     but i think both of them deserve some serious  consideration, along with some other options we have. 	      	     q	  do you think that these people who are trying to  get us into war in bosnia are really remembering that we haven't  taken care of hundreds of thousands of veterans from the last war and  we couldn't take care of our prisoners and get them all home from  vietnam?   and now many of them are coming up with bills for  treatment of agent orange.  how can we afford to go to any more of  these wars? 	      	     the president:  well, i think that's a good argument  against the united states itself becoming involved as a belligerent  in a war there.  but we are, after all, the world's only super power.   we do have to lead the world  and there is a very serious problem of  systematic ethnic cleansing in the former yugoslavia, which could  have not only enormous further humanitarian consequences -- and  goodness knows there have been many -- but also could have other  practical consequences in other nearby regions where the same sorts  of ethnic tensions exist.  	     q	  did you make any kind of agreement with boris  yeltsin to hold off either on air strikes or any kind of aggressive  action against the serbs until after sunday?  and in general, how has  his political situation affected your deliberation on bosnia?  	     the president:  no, i have not made any agreement, and  he did not ask for that.  we never even discussed that, interestingly  enough.  the russians, i would remind you, in the middle of president  yeltsin's campaign, abstained from our attempt to get tougher  sanctions through the united nations in what i thought was the proper  decision for them and one that the united states and, i'm sure, the  rest of the free world very much appreciated.   	     q	  do you wish, mr. president, that you'd become more  involved in the planning of the waco operation?  and how would you  handle that situation differently now?  	     the president:  i don't think as a practical matter that  the president should become involved in the planning of those kinds  of things at that detail.  one of the things that i'm sure will come  out when we look into this is -- the questions will be asked and  answered, did all of us who up the line of command ask the questions  we should have asked and get the answers we should have gotten?  and  i look forward to that.  but at the time, i have to say, as i did  before, the first thing i did after the atf agents were killed, once  we knew that the fbi was going to go in, was to ask that the military  be consulted because of the quasi, as least, military nature of the  conflict given the resources that koresh had in his compound and  their obvious willingness to use them.  and then on the day before  the action, i asked the questions of the attorney general which i  have reported to you previously, and which at the time i thought were  sufficient.  i have -- as i said, i'm sure -- i leave it to others to  make the suggestions about whether there are other questions i should  have asked. 	      	     q	  mr. president, what is your assessment of director  sessions' role in the waco affair?  and have you made a decision on  his future?  and if you haven't, will you give him a personal hearing  before you do decide? 	      	     the president:  well, first of all, i have no assessment  of his role since i had no direct contact with him.  and i mean no  negative or positive inference.  i have no assessment there.  i stand  by what i said before about my general high regard for the fbi.  and  i'm waiting for a recommendation from the attorney general about what  to do with the direction of the fbi. 	      	     q	  mr. president, since you said that one side in  bosnia conflict represents inhumanity that the holocaust carried to  the nth degree, why do you then tell us that the united states cannot  take a partisan view in this war? 	      	     the president:  well, i said that the principle of  ethnic cleansing is something we ought to stand up against.  that  does not mean that the united states or the united nations can enter  a war, in effect, to redraw the lines, geographical lines of  republics within what was yugoslavia, or that that would ultimately  be successful. 	      	     i think what the united states has to do is to try to  figure out whether there is some way consistent with forcing the  people to resolve their own difficulties we can stand up to and stop  ethnic cleansing.  and that is obviously the difficulty we are  wrestling with.  this is clearly the most difficult foreign policy  problem we face, and that all of our allies face.  and if it were  easy, i suppose it would have been solved before.  we have tried to  do more in the last 90 days than was previously done.  it has clearly  not been enough to stop the serbian aggression, and  we are now  looking at what else we can do. 	      	     q	  yesterday you specifically criticized the roosevelt  administration for not having bombed the railroads to the  concentration camps and things that were near military targets.   aren't there steps like that that would not involve conflict --direct  conflict or partisan belligerence that you might consider? 	      	     the president:  there may be.  i would remind you that  the circumstances were somewhat different.  we were then at war with  germany at the time and that's what made that whole incident so -- series of incidents -- so perplexing.  but we have -- as i say, we've  got all of our options under review. 	      	     q	  the diplomatic initiative on haiti is on the verge  of collapse.  what can you do to salvage it short of a full-scale  military operation? 	      	     the president:  well, you may know something i don't.   that's not what our people tell me.  i think mr. caputo and  ambassador pezzullo have done together a good job.  the thing keeps  going back and forth because of the people who are involved with the  de facto government there.  it's obvious what their concerns are.   they were the same concerns that led to the ouster of aristide in the  first place, and president aristide, we feel, should be restored to  power.  we're working toward that.  i get a report on that -- we  discuss it at least three times a week, and i'm convinced that we're  going to prevail there and be successful.   	      	     i do believe that there's every reason to think that  there will have to be some sort of multilateral presence to try to  guarantee the security and the freedom from violence of people on  both sides of the ledger while we try to establish the conditions of  ongoing civilized society.  but i believe we're going to prevail  there. 	      	     q	  mr. president, would you care to make your  assessment of the first 100 days before we make one for you?   (laughter.) 	      	     the president:  well, i'll say if -- i believe, first of  all, we passed the budget resolution in record time.  that was the  biggest issue.  that confirmed the direction of the administration  and confirmed the commitments of the campaign that we could both  bring the deficit down and increase investment, and that we could do  it by specific spending cuts and by raising taxes, almost all of  which come from the highest income people in this society --reversing  a 12-year trend in which most of the tax burdens were borne by the  middle class, whose incomes were going down when their taxes were  going up, while the deficit went from $1 trillion to $4 trillion, the  total national debt, and the deficit continued to go up. 	      	     we have a 20-year low in interest rates from mortgages.  we have lower interest rates across the board.  we have tens of  billions of dollars flooding back into this economy as people  refinance their debt.   	      	     we have established a new environmental policy, which is  dramatically different.  the secretary of education has worked with  me and with others and with the governors to establish a new approach  in education that focuses on tough standards, as well as increasing  opportunity.  we have done an enormous amount of work on political  reform, on campaign finance and lobbying reform.  and i have imposed  tough ethics requirements on my own administration's officials.   these things are consistent with not only what i said i'd do in the  campaign, but with turning the country around.  the vice president is  heading a task force which will literally change the way the federal  government operates and make it much more responsive to the citizens  of this country.   	      	     we are working on a whole range of other things.  the  welfare reform initiative, to move people from welfare to work.  and,  of course, a massive amount of work has been done on the health care  issue, which is a huge economic and personal security problem for  millions of americans.   	      	     so i think it is amazing how much has been done.  more  will be done.  we also passed the family leave bill.  a version of  the motor voter bill -- that has not come out of conference back to  me yet.  and everything has been passed except the stimulus program.   so i think we're doing fine and we're moving in the right direction.   i feel good about it. 	      	     q	  sir, a follow-up.  wouldn't you say, though, that  one of your biggest initiatives, aid to soviet russia, is now  practically finished -- if we can't pass a stimulus bill in our own  country, how can we do it for them? 	      	     the president:  let me recast the question a little bit.   it's a good question -- (laughter) -- it's a good question, but to be  fair we've got to recast it.  we have already -- the first round of  aid to the soviet -- to non-soviet russia, to a democratic russia, is  plainly going to go through, the first $1.6 billion.  the aid that we  agreed with our partners in the g-7 to provide through the  international financial institutions, which is a big dollar item, is  plainly going to go through.  the question is, can we get any more  aid for russia that requires a new appropriation by the united states  congress?  and that is a question i think, mary, that will be  resolved in the weeks ahead, in part by what happens to the american  workers and their jobs and their future.  i think the two things will  be tied by many members of congress.  	     q	  the tailhook report came out this morning,  documenting horrendous and nearly-criminal conduct on the part of the  navy.  how much did you discuss the incident and what might be done  about it with your nominee to be the secretary of the navy?  	     the president:  first, let me comment a little on that.   the inspector general's report details conduct which is wrong and  which has no place in the armed services.  and i expect the report to  be acted on in the appropriate way.  i also want to say to the  american people and to all of you that the report should be taken for  what it is, a very disturbing list of allegations which will have to  be thoroughly examined.  it should not be taken as a general  indictment of the united states navy or of all the fine people who  serve there.  it is very specific in its allegations, and it will be  pursued.    	     the only thing i said to the secretary-designate of the  navy and the only thing i should have said to him, i think, is that i  expected him to take the report and to do his duty.  and i believe he  will do that.  	     q	  mr. president, to back to russia for just a minute.   the latest poll show that mr. yeltsin will probably win his vote of  confidence.  but there seems to be a real toss-up on whether or not  voters are going to endorse his economic reforms.    	     the president:  i understand that.    	     q	  can you live with a split -- (laughter) -- can you  live with a split decision, though, or do you need both passed in  order to then build support for russian aid?  	     the president:  i believe -- the answer to your question  is, for the united states, the key question should be that which is  posed to any democracy, which is who wins the election.  if he wins  the election, if he is ratified by the russian people to continue as  their president, then i think we should do our best to work with him  toward reform. 	      	     you know, we had a lot of other countries here for the  holocaust museum dedication -- their leaders were here.  leaders from  eastern europe, leaders from at least one republic of the former  soviet union; all of them having terrible economic challenges as they  convert from a communist command and control economy to a market  economy in a world where there's economic slowdown everywhere.  and  in a world in which there's economic slowdown and difficulty, all  leaders will have trouble having their policies be popular in a poll  because they haven't produced the results that the people so  earnestly yearn for.  you can understand that.   	      	     but if they have confidence in the leadership, i think  that's all we can ask.  and the united states will -- if the russian  people ratify him as their president and stick with him then the  united states will continue to work with him.  i think he is a  genuine democrat -- small d -- and genuinely committed to reform.  i  think that we should support that.  	     q	  mr. president, mr. perot has come out strongly in  what is perceived behind the line against a free trade agreement -- nafta.  how hard are you going to fight for this free trade agreement  and when do you expect to see it accomplished? 	      	     the president:  i think we'll have the agreement ready  in the fairly near future.  you know, our people are still working  with the mexican government and with the canadians on the side  agreements.  we're trying to work out what the environmental  agreement will say, what the labor agreement will say, and then what  the fairest way to deal with enforcement is.   	      	     the mexicans say, and there is some merit to their  position, that they're worried about transferring their sovereignty  in enforcement to a multilateral commission.  even in the united  states, to be fair, we have some folks who are worried about that -- about giving that up.  on the other hand, if we're going to have an  environmental agreement and a labor standards agreement that means  something, then there has to be ultimately some consequences for  violating them.  so what we're trying to do is to agree on an  approach which would say that if there is a pattern of violations -- if you keep on violating it past a certain point -- maybe not an  isolated incident, but a pattern of violation -- there is going to be  some enforcement.  there must be consequences.  and we're working out  the details of that. 	      	     but i still feel quite good about it.  and this is just  an area where i disagree with mr. perot and with others.  i think  that we will win big if we have a fair agreement that integrates more  closely the mexican economy and the american economy and leads us  from there to chile to other market economies in latin america, and  gives us a bigger world in which to trade.  i think that's the only  way a rich country can grow richer.  if you look at what japan and  other countries in the pacific are doing to reach out in their own  region, it's a pretty good lesson to us that we had better worry  about how to build those bridges in our own area.   	      	     so this is an idea battle.  you know, you've got a lot  of questions and i want to answer them all, but let me say not every  one of these things can be distilled simply into politics -- you  know, who's for this and who's for that, and if this person is for  this, somebody else has got to be for that.  a lot of these things  honestly involved real debates over ideas, over who's right and wrong  about the world toward which we're moving.  and the answers are not  self-evident.  and one of the reasons that i wanted to run for  president is i wanted to sort of open the floodgates for debating  these ideas so that we could try to change in the appropriate way.   so i just have a difference of opinion.  i believe that the concept  of nafta is sound, even though, as you know, i thought that the  details needed to be improved. 	      	     q	  mr. president, there was a tremendous flurry of  interest earlier this month in the russian document that purported to  show that the vietnamese had held back american prisoners.  general  vessey has now said publicly that while the document itself was  authentic, he believes that it was incorrect.  do you have a personal  view at this point about that issue?  and more broadly, do you  believe that, in fact, the vietnamese did return all the american  prisoners at the time of the paris peace accord? 	      	     the president:  first let me say, i saw general vessey  before he went to vietnam and after he returned.  and i have a high  regard for him and i appreciate his willingness to serve his country  in this way.  as to whether the document had any basis in fact, let  me say that the government of vietnam was more forthcoming than it  had been in the past and gave us some documents that would tend to  undermine the validity of the russian documents claim. 	      	     i do not know whether that is right or wrong.  we are  having it basically evaluated at this time, and when we complete the  evaluation, we'll tell you.  and, of course, we want to tell the  families of those who were missing in action or who were pows.  i  think that we'll be able to make some progress in eliminating some of  the questions about the outstanding cases as a result of this last  interchange, but i cannot say that i'm fully satisfied that we know  all that we need to know.  there are still some cases that we don't  know the answer to.  but i do believe we're making some progress.  i  was encouraged by the last trip. 	      	     q	  i'd like to follow up on that.  before the u.s.  normalizes relations, allows trade to go forward, do you have to be  personally sure that every case has been resolved or would you be  willing to go forward on the basis that while it may take years to  resolve these cases, the vietnamese have made sufficient offerings to  us to confirm good faith? 	      	     the president:  a lot of experts say you can never  resolve every case, every one, that we couldn't resolve all the cases  for them and that there are still some cases that have not been  factually resolved, going back to the second world war.  but what i  would have to be convinced of is that we had gone a long way toward  resolving every case that could be resolved at this moment in time,  and that there was a complete, open and unrestricted commitment to  continue to do everything that could be done always to keep resolving  those cases.  and we're not there yet.   	      	     again, i have to be guided a little bit by people who  know a lot about this.  and i confess to being much more heavily  influenced by the families of the people whose lives were lost there,  or whose lives remain in question than by the commercial interest and  the other things which seem so compelling in this moment.  i just am  very influenced by how the families feel. 	      	     q	     your economic stimulus package, are you doing  some kind of reality check now and scaling back some of your plans,  your legislative plans for the coming year, including the crime bill,  the health care initiative and other things?  are there any plans to  do that?  and also, did you underestimate the power of senator bob  dole? 	      	     the president:  no, what i underestimated was the extent  to which what i thought was a fairly self-evident case, particularly  after we stayed below the spending caps approved by this congress,  including the republicans who were in this congress last year -- when  we had already passed a budget resolution which called for over $500  billion in deficit reduction.  when they had voted repeatedly for  supplemental appropriations to help foreign governments, i thought at  least four of them would vote to break cloture, and i underestimated  that.  i did not have an adequate strategy of dealing with that.   	      	     i also thought that if i made a good-faith effort to  negotiate and to compromise, that it would not be rebuffed.  instead,  every time i offered something they reduced the offer that they had  previously been talking to the majority leader about.  so it was a  strange set of events.  but i think what happened was what was a  significant part of our plan, but not the major part of it, acquired  a political connotation that got out of proportion to the merits, so  that a lot of republicans were saying to me privately, ""mr.  president, i'd like to be for this, but i can't now.  and we're all  strung out and we're divided.""   	      	     and i think we need to do a reality check.  as i said,  what i want to know -- let me go back to what i said -- what i want  to know from our folks and from our friends in the senate on -- and  republicans or democrats -- is what could i have done differently to  make it come out differently.  because the real losers here were not  the president and the administration.  the real losers were the  hundreds of thousands of people who won't have jobs now.  we could  have put another 700,000 kids to work this summer.  i mean, we could  have done a lot of good things with that money.  and i think that is  very, very sad.  and it became more political than it should have.   but the underlying rationale i don't think holds a lot of water -- that it was deficit spending.  that just won't wash. 	      	     q	     and redo -- 	      	     the president:  no.  i mean, you know, for example --you  mentioned the crime bill.  i think it would be a real mistake not to  pass the crime bill.  i mean, the crime bill was almost on the point  of passage last year.  and they were all fighting over the brady  bill.  surely, surely after what we have been through in this country  just in the last three months, with the kind of mindless violence we  have seen, we can pass a bill requiring people to go through a  waiting period before they buy a handgun.  and surely we can see that  we need more police officers on the street.   	      	     that's another thing that -- i really believe that once  we move some of that money -- not all, but some of it up into this  jobs package to make some of the jobs rehiring police officers on the  street who'd been laid off, that would be a compelling case.  i mean  people are scared in this country and i think we need to go forward.  i feel very strongly that we need to go forward on the crime bill. 	      	     q	  mr. president, back to the tailhook report for a  second.  that report contained very strong criticism of the navy's  senior leadership in general, but did not name any of the senior  officers.  do you believe that the senior officers who are implicated  in this, including admiral kelso who was there one night in las  vegas, should they be disciplined and do you believe the public has a  right to know the names of the senior officers? 	      	     the president:  you should know that under the rules of  law which apply to this, i am in the chain of command.  there is now  an inspector general's report and the law must take its course.  if i  were to answer that question i might prejudice any decisions which  might be later made in this case.  i don't really think -- i think  all i can tell you is what i have already said.  i was very disturbed  by the specific allegations in the inspector general's report, and i  want appropriate action to be taken.   	      	     until the proper procedures have a chance to kick in and  appropriate action is taken, i have been advised that because i am  the commander-in-chief i have to be very careful about what i say so  as not to prejudice the rights of anybody against whom any action  might proceed or to prejudice the case in any other way either pro or  con.  so i can't say any more except to say that i want this thing  handled in an appropriate and thorough way. 	      	     q	  mr. president, could i ask you for a clarification  on bosnia?  you said that you were not considering introduction of  american forces.  does that include any air forces as well as ground  forces, sir? 	      	     the president:  i said ground forces. 	      	     q	  you said ground forces.  could i ask you, sir, if  you fear that using u.s. air strikes might  draw the united states  into a ground war there? 	      	     the president:  i just don't want to discuss our  evaluation of the options anymore.  i've told you that there's never  been a serious discussion in this country about the introduction of  ground forces into an ongoing conflict there. 	      	     q	  with hundreds of thousands of gays in washington  this weekend for the march, did you ever reconsider your decision to  leave town for this weekend?

"here again, the problem with most of the individuals posting here, you take the biblical account as though it were some sort of historical recounting in the modern sense.  i would refer you to john dominic crossans book _the cross that spoke_ (pub. harper and row, 1988).  the earliest texts which we have make no reference to an empty tomb.  nor is an empty tomb necessary for a claim of resurrection. modern evangelicals/fundamentalists have completely missed what the point of resurrection is -- here the work of george nickelsburg's work  _resurrection, immortality, and eternal life in intertestamental judaism_ (publ cambridge, havard univ. press, 1972) is most helpful.  look at rom 1:1-3.  paul here has no need of an empty tomb.  additionally in 1 cor 15, here again there is no mention of an empty tomb. he was raised (note the passive), he appeared, no ascension either.  resurrection could be accomplished without ever disturbing the bones in the grave.  the whole idea of an empty tomb isn't broached in any of our texts until well after the fall of jerusalem.  by that time, the idea of coming up with a body would have been ludicrious.  moreover mack has argued (convicingly, i think) that the empty tomb story first appears in mark (we have no texts before this which mention the tomb).         you are quite right here.  even the idea of a subjective mystical event as the foundation of the resurrection narratives is currently becoming more untenable. see b. mack _a myth of innocence_.",15,soc.religion.christian

"the problem is that motif uses xgrabkey to implement menu accelerators, and these grabs are specific about which modifiers apply.  unfortunately, the specification for xgrabkey doesn't allow anymodifier to be combined with other modifiers, which is exactly what would be desired in this case: ""ctrl any<key>q"".   this is true for accelerators and mnemonics, which are implemented using event handlers instead of grabs; it's not true for menu accelerators.  if you're a motif implementor, i'd suggest lobbying to get the xlib semantics changed to support the feature i described above.  otherwise, change the documentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user's expectations, because menu accelerators are not the same thing as translations.   if you mean ""menu accelerator"", no it's not possible.  that's according to the definition of the xmnaccelerator resource in the xmlabel manual page.   i can't think of a reason why not.   there is a workaround for motif users.  in addition to the normal menu accelerator you install on the xmpushbutton[gadget], set an xtnaccelerators resource on the shell (toplevel or application).  install the shell's accelerators on itself and all of its descendants with xtinstallallaccelerators (shell, shell).  for example,    applicationshell - mainwindow - menubar - filecascade 					  -- filepulldown - openpushbutton 							  - exitpushbutton    *openpushbutton.accelerator = ctrl<key>o   *openpushbutton.acceleratortext = ctrl+o   *exitpushbutton.accelerator = ctrl<key>q   *exitpushbutton.acceleratortext = ctrl+q    *applicationshell.accelerators = #override\n\     ctrl<key>o: performaction(*openpushbutton, armandactivate)\n\     ctrl<key>q: performaction(*exitpushbutton, armandactivate)  you have to write and add the application action performaction, which you can implement by using xtnametowidget on the first argument and then xtcallactionproc with the rest of the arguments.  i tested out something similar to this.  to shorten development time, i used teleuse's tuninstallaccelerators resource to install the accelerators on the shell, and i directly invoked the open and quit d actions instead of asking the pushbuttons to do it for me, but the more general approach i described above should work.",5,comp.windows.x

"there are two things at work here ... the public insurance is very wide in what it will cover, as the amortization is also universal. no private plan can boast of a plan that fits a gaussian curve ... and as our private sector has discovered, they're better off not offering insurance coverage that their customers are going to use. (-;   the alternative to the system is no system at all (patients opted out, doctors opted out, or both).  but that only for insurance ... and you can't force a private insurance company to sell you a plan that they will not offer.  and remember that the actual health care is delivered by private entities who collect from the public insurance voluntarily. again, they can't force a private entity to spring to life to pay them.  plus, there is the matter of culture and values ... i'm basically anti-tax and anti-government, by canadian standards ... yet i can't bring myself to make the same arguments as you do, despite that i understand where you're coming from.  up north, you're so much more likely to find someone protesting taxes going to defence than health insurance premiums to only one fund for basic coverage ...   yes, primarily in quebec and in alberta.  sorry, i musta lost you in that verbose blurb ...   in canada and germany, it's not mandatory.  however, it is negative option in that you must request the exemption.  that the private sector will not provide private basic coverage if offered the option (as in the quebec case) tells me something about what they know ...   yes, but part of the reason is that our most of our markets are too small to sustain many specialists, sometimes not even one, so you pretty well have to be a gp to get paid.  and if you do get the training, the doctors monopoly might block your getting of a licence because there is already someone in the business and who cannot fill his/her appointment book.  that we have a cma doctors monopoly is something that the american ama-oriented medical lobby never tells you down here ...   no, i respect people who do specialties (okay, all of my md friends are (-;) but there's the question of our small market dynamics up north ... if anything, that our private doctors and hospitals sell their services to americans to generate more business will inflate their effective population served, and thus make some specialties finally viable (i.e., there will be enough customers).  we just do not have enough sick canadians in absolute numbers otherwise.   uh ... germany basically uses our method, with their many sickness funds.  the competition is fake if it exists at all, because they're all interlinked.  look in der spiegel or stern (my girlfriend is in our german department  and her uncle is a private practicioner in saarbrucken) ... no ads for health insurance.  while canada organizes by province, germany organizes the paperwork around big corporations and regional offices.   but remember that we have provinces that have the same population as some major german corporations.  germans have public health insurance, just that it is brokered by smaller entities (actually, brokerage of basic by private firms who'll sell extra insurance to fill out their policies, sort of a voucher system, was one of the first ideas floated in canada, too).  remember, the germans don't have hmo's ... a telling sign, 'cos rochester does and they're also a company town.   i'll have to let a canadian md jump in to verify that claim, but i've come to learn to suspect anything in the american press about our ""system"".  if much or some of it were true, you'd have to take us for idiots for tolerating it.  and given that our insurance was installed during a period when there were only liberal and tory governments federally and provincially, and the socialists are still chafing, they would've pressed for real socialized medicine to fix things ... think about it.  after all, we are using the u.s. as a metric to make comparison ... both for keeping-up-with-the-joneses as for confirming that we did something right.  gld",18,talk.politics.misc

[ suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients   (eg: xclock, xterm, xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]    i've received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject   of x client programs.  some advocate the use of programs that are   strictly xlib based, since xt, xaw and other toolkits are rather   large.  others warn us that other applications which you are using   may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  in   this case, using a non-xt (for example) client program may actually   _increase_ the amount of ram consumed.    the upshot of all this seems to be: don't mix toolkits.  that is, try   and use just athena clients, or just xview clients (or just motif   clients, etc).  if you use more than one, then you're dragging in   more than one toolkit library.    know your environment, and think carefully about which client   programs would work best together in that environment.

(this will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)      - use a line width of 0 in gcs.  on some servers this makes a huge       difference.      - compress and collapse multiple expose events.  this can make the       difference between a fast application and a completely unusable       one.    francois staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) :     just a small remark: i once heard that using a better malloc     function would greatly increase performance of xt based     applications since they use malloc heavily. they suggested trying     out the gnuy malloc, but i didn't find the time yet. i did some     tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the     differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)    [ any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.]    andre' beck (andre_beck@irs.inf.tu-dresden.de) :    - unnecessary noexpose events.      most people use xcopyarea/xcopyplane as fastest blit routines, but     they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the gc used for the     blits. this will cause a noexpose event every blit, that, in most     cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to     run through it's event-loop again and again.    - thousands of xchangegc requests.      this ""gfx context switching"" is also seen in most handcoded x-apps,     where only one or few gcs are created and then heavily changed     again and again.  xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching     and sharing a lot of gcs with all needed parameters. this will     remove the load of subsequent xchangegc requests from the     connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).  say what!? - - - - - -    some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:    david b. lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org, by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) :     how about this: swap displays with someone else. run all your programs     on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your     machine onto the other display. goal: reduce context switches in the     same operation between client and server.    i'm not in a situation where i can easily try this, but i have received   the following confirmation...    michael salmon (michael.salmon@eos.ericsson.se):     i regularly run programs on other machines and i notice a big     difference. i try to run on a machine where i will reduce net usage     and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. this     helps a lot on my poor little ss1+ with only 16 mb, it was     essential when i only had 8 mb.    casey leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) :     [the x11 server and the client are] competing for the same cpu as     your server when you run it on the same machine.  not really a     major problem, except that the x11 client and the server are in     absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing.    timothy h panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) :     firstly it relies on the fact that most cpu's are mostly idle, x's     cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate     doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. if they     are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your     action.      the second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2     cpu's halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going     over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved     buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing     even fewer context switches.  ---------------------------- other sources of information ----------------------------    volume 8 in o'reilly's x window system series, ``x window system   administrator's guide'' is a book all x administrator's should read.    adrian nye (adrian@ora.com):     a lot more tips on performance are in the paper ""improving x     application performance"" by chris d. peterson and sharon chang, in     issue 3 of the x resource.      an earlier version of this paper appeared in the xhibition 1992     conference proceedings.      this paper is absolutely essential reading for x programmers.  -------------- author & notes --------------   this list is currently maintained by art mulder (art@cs.ualberta.ca)    suggestions, corrections, or submission for inclusion in this list   are gladly accepted.  layout suggestions and comments (spelling   mistak's too! :-) are also welcome.    currently i have listed all contributors of the various comments and   suggestions.  if you do not want to be credited, please tell me.    speedup-x-faq is copyright (c) 1993 by arthur e. mulder    you may copy this document in whole or in part as long as you don't   try to make money off it, or pretend that you wrote it.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -",5,comp.windows.x

"this definitely had nothing to do with the entry of the government into the support of science; some of it is relevant in technology.  there was little involvement of federal funds, or except through support of state universities, of state funds, for scientific research before wwii. the us research position had been growing steadily, and the funding was mainly from university and private foundation funds.  there were not that many research universities, but they all provided their researchers with low teaching loads, laboratories, assistants, and equipment, and funds for travel to scientific meetings.  not that much, but it was provided, and a university wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as well as salary.  during wwii, the military and the defense departments found that pure scientists could do quite well with their problems, even though they  were not exactly in the areas of the scientists' expertise.  this is probably because of the ""research mind"" approach, which is not to try to find a solution, but to understand the problem and see if a solution emerges.  this works in stages, and as research scientists were used to discussion about their problems, the job got done.  the military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for the future, and started funding pure research after wwii.  but congress was unwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into the future supply of scientists, and set up other organizations, such as  nsf, to do the job.  it also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly keep politics out.  also, the government did a job on private foundations, making it more difficult for them to act to support research.  the worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in which the government supports research the university will not provide funding, and in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money.  suppose, as has been the case, i have a project which could use the assistance of a graduate student for a few months.  what do you think happens if i ask for one?  the answer i will get is, ""get the money from nsf.""  now the money at the university level is a few thousand, but at the nsf level it comes to about 20 thousand, and is likely to keep a faculty member from getting supported.  so the government is, in effect, deciding which projects get supported, and how much.    also, the government decided that the ""wealth"" should be spread.  so instead of having a moderate number of universities which were primarily research institutions, the idea that more schools should get into the act came into being.  and instead of evaluating scholars, they had to go to evaluating reseach proposals.  as a researcher, i can tell you that any research proposal has to be mainly wishful thinking, or as now happens, the investigator conceals already done work to release it as the results of the research.  what i am proposing today i may solve before the funding is granted, i may find  impossible, or i may find that it is too difficult.  in addition, tomorrow i may get unexpected research results.  possibly i may bet a bright idea which solves yesterday's too difficult problem, or a whole new approach to something i had not considered can develop.  this is the nature of the beast,  and except for really vague statements, if something can be predicted, it is not major research, but development or routine activity not requiring  more than minimal attention of a good researcher.    i believe that at this time less quality research is being done than would have happened if the government had never gotten into it, and the government is trying to divert researchers from thinkers to plodders.",14,sci.space

"not particularly *in* the world series. during the season, he was probably more valuable than, say, putting olerud out there to pitch, but yeah, he *was* valuable in getting them there. in the postseason, he sucked dirty canal water through a straw. the jays won *in spite* of morris much more than *because of* him.   umm, roger? return with us to those halcyon days of a few postings ago, where the poster valentine was replying to used # of ws rings as a measure of better. the concept is called ""context"", and you should really become familiar with it someday.   unless this transaltes to ""clemens hasn't gone into lou gorman's office with a large caliber handgun and refused to come out until he'd been traded to the jays,"" i'm at a complete loss as to any possible meaning for it.   what on earth does this mean? over their careers, clemens has ""won"" 68% of the games he's started, morris 58%. per year, clemens has averaged nearly 17 wins, morris just under 15. would you grant the proposition that preventing the other team from scoring increases your chances of winning  a game? if so, then consider that clemens allows 2.8 runs/9 innings pitched. morris allows nearly a run more per nine innings. in fact, jack morris has never in his career had an era for a single year as good as clemens' career era. but i forget, in the maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significance to buckner missing that grounder in 1986; had morris been on the sox, it would have been a routine groundout, right?   speaking of stupid, it has been patiently (and not-so-patiently) explained to you many times that attributing greatness to players based on the accomplishments of their teams makes about as much sense as claiming that a racecar has the most attractive paint job because it won the race. your continued failure to not only understand but even to intelligently reply to any of the arguments presented leads me to the conclusion that you must have spent a few too many games in goal without a mask.   no one is crying; the jays won, and as a team they certainly deserved to win at least the al east. they performed well in two short series and won the world series, and i congratulate them for it. as a red sox fan, i hope they keep morris. i was happy when they picked up stewart, and elated when they traded for darrin jackson. you see, unless you believe in some mystical link between morris and the offense, you can hardly help but believe that the man was credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky. luck runs out, just like it did in 1982 when he pitched 50-odd more innings than 1992, gave up exactly *one* earned run more than in 1992, and went 17-16.  seriously, roger, i'd really like to hear your explanation of the difference between the 1982 morris and the 1992 morris. which one was a better pitcher, and why? did morris somehow ""learn how to win"" in the intervening ten years? if so, then why did he go 18-12 in 1991 with minnesota with an era over half a run lower than 1992?   mike jones | aix high-end development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com",9,rec.sport.baseball

"april 16, 1993  initial eff analysis of clinton privacy and security proposal  the clinton administration today made a major announcement on cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of millions of americans.  the first part of the plan is to begin a comprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as export controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to robust encryption, and law enforcement issues posed by new technology.  however, eff is very concerned that the administration has already reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before any public comment or discussion has been allowed.  apparently, the administration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone equipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the national security agency.  the so-called ""clipper chip"" is an 80-bit, split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips manufactured by a military contractor.  two separate escrow agents would store users' keys, and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant.  the encryption scheme used is to be classified, but the chips will be available to any manufacturer for incorporation into its communications products.       this proposal raises a number of serious concerns .  first, the administration has adopted a solution before conducting an inquiry.  the nsa-developed clipper chip may not be the most secure product. other vendors or developers may have better schemes. furthermore, we should not rely on the government as the sole source for the clipper or any other chips.  rather, independent chip manufacturers should be able to produce chipsets based on open standards.  second, an algorithm cannot be trusted unless it can be tested. yet, the administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified.  eff believes that any standard adopted ought to be public and open.  the public will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is open to independent, expert scrutiny.    third, while the use of the use of a split-key, dual escrowed system may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement needs, the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is adopted.  what will give people confidence in the safety of their keys?  does disclosure of keys to a third party waive an individual's fifth amendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries?  these are but a few of the many questions the administrations proposal raised but fails to answer.  in sum, the administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy and security.  however, the ""clipper chip"" solution ought to be considered as part of the inquiry, and not be adopted before the discussion even begins.  details of the proposal:  escrow  the 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of whom hold 40-bits of each key.  the manufacturer of the communications device would be required to register all keys with the two independent escrow agents.  a key is tied to the device, however, not the person using it.  upon presentation of a valid court order, the two escrow agents would have to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents.  according to the presidential directive just issued, the attorney general will be asked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  some in the administration have suggested that one non-law enforcement federal agency (perhaps the federal reserve), and one non-governmental organization could be chosen, but there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet.  classified algorithm and the possibility of back doors  the administration claims that there are no back doors -- means by which the government or others could break the code without securing keys from the escrow agents -- and that the president will be told there are no back doors to this classified algorithm.  in order to prove this, administration sources are interested in arranging for an all-star crypto cracker team to come in, under a security arrangement, and examine the algorithm for trap doors.  the results of the investigation would then be made public.  the clipper chipset was designed and is being produced and a sole-source, secret contract between the national security agency and two private firms:  vlsi and mycotronx.  nsa work on this plan has been underway for about four years.  the manufacturing contract was let 14 months ago.  government as market driver  in order to get a market moving, and to show that the government believes in the security of this system, the feds will be the first big customers for this product.  users will include the fbi, secret service, vp al gore, and maybe even the president.  at today's commerce department press briefing, a number of people asked this question, though:  why would any private organization or individual adopt a classified standard that had no independent guaranty of security or freedom from trap doors?  comprehensive policy inquiry  the administration has also announced that it is about to commence an inquiry into all policy issues related to privacy protection, encryption, and law enforcement.  the items to be considered include:  export controls on encryption technology and the fbi's digital telephony proposal.  it appears that the this inquiry will be conducted by the national security council.  unfortunately, however, the presidential directive describing the inquiry is classified.  some public involvement in the process has been promised, but they terms have yet to be specified.  from more information contact:  jerry berman, executive director (jberman@eff.org) daniel j. weitzner, senior staff counsel (djw@eff.org)  full text of the press releases and fact sheets issued by the administration will be available on eff's ftp site.",11,sci.crypt

"that depends entirely upon the advertiser whose number you circled. radio electronics compiles all of the cards, then each advertiser gets a computer printout of the names and addresses of all of the readers who circled their number. some magazines also provide the data on self-adhesive labels, and the really big magazines provide the data on computer disk.  the advertiser decides what to do with the data they get. you will notice that the radio electronics information card (commonly called a ""bingo card"" in the industry) includes lines for a company name and a business phone number. my guess would be that the big, national advertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as best they can. for example, if you include motorola as your company and include a business phone (and a mail stop), tektronics will probably send you a copy of their hard-bound catalog and have a sales engineer call you about a week later. if you leave it blank, odds are they will send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail outlet. medium and small companies are more likely to send you th e whole catalog. and then some companies, like digikey or jameco, have nothing to mail out accept the catalog.  a couple of other interesting points about bingo cards: free, industry magazines like edn and such also log your card to their computer. they use the information at least three ways. they note that you really do read the magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or push you, through repeated mailings, to re-subscribe. they also compile how many people requested which data for their marketing demographics. this way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that ""23% of readers requesting data were interested in capacitors."" and finally, some magazines rent lists of readers who request certain information. for example, tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested information about test equipment other than tektronic's, in the past 6 months.  the other point, in the data the advertiser receives, many magazines include how many items you circled on the card. if they want, the advertiser can attempt to cull out the ""literature collectors"" from the serious potential customers.  ""can you say qualified sales leads? i thought you could.""  what's the best way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards?    never circle more than 8 number on the card. if you want more   than 8 items, use the second card and mail it a couple of   weeks later.    if you are really, really serious and you really, really want   the information, call the advertiser and ask! this will also   cut about 15 days off the the response time. virtually   everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data   on a computer printout.    to help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that you're   not really ""qualified"" for, send in a bingo card at least every   other month and circle two or three numbers.    include a business name and phone number, even if it's your house.   advertisers almost never call.",12,sci.electronics

"-*----  far from being ""tossed out,"" the gospels are taken, almost universally, as the primary source of information about jesus. i am curious as to whom mike cobb is referring.  who ""tosses out"" the new testament?  undoubtedly a few *naive* atheists do this, but the phrasing of the question above seems to suggest that cobb ascribes this more broadly.  perhaps the question that gets more to the heart of the matter is why, except for some *naive* believers (who, unfortunately, far outnumber nonbelievers, both naive and critical), are the gospels *not* taken as ""gospel truth"" that faithfully records just what happened two thousand years ago?  this has an easy answer, and the answer has *nothing* to do with miracles: no text is taken this way by a critical reader.  there is a myth among some naive believers that one takes a text, measures it by some set of criteria, and then either confirms the text as ""historically valid"" or ""tosses out"" the text.  i suspect this myth comes from the way history is presented in primary and secondary school, where certain texts are vested with authority, and from writers such as josh mcdowell who pretend to present historical arguments along these lines for their religious program.  in fact, most texts used in primary and secondary school history classes ought to be tossed out, even the better such texts should not be treated as authoritatively as descibed above, and josh mcdowell would not know a historical argument if it bit him on the keister twice.  let me present the barest outlines of a different view of texts and their use in studying history.  first, all texts are historically valid.  all texts.  or to put this another way, i have never seen a notion of ""historical validity"" that makes any sense when applied to a text.  second, no text should be read as telling the ""gospel truth"" about historical events, in the way that many students are wont to read history texts in primary and secondary school.  no text.  (this includes your favorite author's history of whatever.)  every text is a historical fact.  every text was written by some person (or some group of people) for some purpose.  hence, every text can serve as historical evidence.  the question is: what can we learn from a text?  of what interesting things (if any) does the text provide evidence?  the diaries of the followers of the maharishi, formerly of oregon, are historical evidence.  the gospels are historical evidence.  the letters of the officers who participated in the  vampire inquests in eastern europe are historical evidence.  the modern american history textbooks that whitewash ""great american figures"" are historical evidence.  these are all historical evidence of various things.  they are *not* much evidence at all that the maharishi, formerly of oregon, could levitate; that jesus was resurrected; that vampires exist; or that ""great american figures"" are as squeaky clean as we learned in school. they are better evidence that some people ""saw"" the maharishi, late of oregon, levitate; that some of the early christians thought jesus was resurrected; that many people in eastern europe ""saw"" vampires return from the grave; and that we still have an educational system that largely prefers to spread myth rather than teach history.  how does one draw causal connections and infer what a piece of historical evidence -- text or otherwise -- evinces?  this is a very complex question that has no easily summarized answer. there are many books on the subject or various parts of the subject.  i enjoy david hackett fischer's ""historian's fallacies"" as a good antidote to the uncritical way in which it is so easy to read texts present history.  it's relatively cheap.  it's easy to read.  give it a try.",19,talk.religion.misc

"there was an interesting article in scientific american some time ago about breathing liquid. (it was a few months before _the abyss_ came out.) as far as i can remember, they mentioned three things that were difficult to do at once with a substitute breathing fluid:   - low viscosity --- if it's too difficult to force the fluid in & out      of the lungs, you can't extract enough oxygen to power your own     breathing effort (let alone anything else)    - diffusion rate --- obviously, not all the air in your lungs is     expelled when you breathe out; and the part that isn't expelled     is the part that's nearest the walls of the alveoli. (alveolus?)     so the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done     by diffusion of the gas through the fluid. apparently oxygen     tends to diffuse more readily than co2, so even if you can get enough     oxygen in, you might not be able to get enough co2 out.    - oxygen/co2 capacity --- you have to be able to dissolve enough     gas per unit volume.     oh, and of course, your new breathing fluid must not irritate the lungs or interfere with their healing or anything like that...",14,sci.space

the issue is people.  millions of americans are waiting for this legislation and counting on it, counting on us in washington.  but the jobs bill has been grounded by gridlock.                              i know the american people are tired of business as usual and politics as usual.  i know they don't want us to spin or wheels.  they want the recovery to get moving.  so i have taken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extra mile.  yesterday i offered to cut the size of this plan by 25 percent -- from $16 billion to $12 billion.                              it's not what i'd hoped for.  with 16 million americans looking for full-time work, i simply can't let the bill languish when i know that even a compromise bill will mean hundreds of thousands of jobs for our people.  the mandate is to act to achieve change and move the country forward.  by taking this initiative in the face of an unrelenting senate talkathon, i think we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significant portion of our original goals.                            first, we want to keep the programs as much as possible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs, including highway and road construction, summer jobs for young people, immunization for children, construction of waste water sites, and aid to small businesses.  we also want to keep funding for extended unemployment compensation benefits, for people who have been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn't creating jobs.                            second, i've recommended that all the other programs in the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40 percent.                            and third, i've recommended a new element in this program to help us immediately start our attempt to fight against crime by providing $200 million for cities and towns to rehire police officers who lost their jobs during the recession and put them back to work protecting our people.  i'm also going to fight for a tough crime bill because the people of this country need it and deserve it.                            now, the people who are filibustering this bill -- the republican senators -- say they won't vote for it because it increases deficit spending, because there's extra spending this year that hasn't already been approved.  that sounds reasonable, doesn't it?  here's what they don't say.  this program is more than paid for by budget cuts over my five-year budget, and this budget is well within the spending limits already approved by the congress this year.                            it's amazing to me that many of these same senators who are filibustering the bill voted during the previous administration for billions of dollars of the same kind of emergency spending, and much of it was not designed to put the american people to work.                              this is not about deficit spending.  we have offered a plan to cut the deficit.  this is about where your priorities are -- on people or on politics.                              keep in mind that our jobs bill is paid for dollar for dollar.  it is paid for by budget cuts.  and it's the soundest investment we can now make for ourselves and our children.  i urge all americans to take another look at this jobs and investment program; to consider again the benefits for all of us when we've helped make more american partners working to ensure the future of our nation and the strength of our economy.                            you know, if every american who wanted a job had one, we wouldn't have a lot of the other problems we have in this country today.  this bill is not a miracle, it's a modest first step to try to set off a job creation explosion in this country again.  but it's a step we ought to take.  and it is fully paid for over the life of our budget.                            tell your lawmakers what you think.  tell them how important the bill is.  if it passes, we'll all be winners.                            good morning, and thank you for listening.",18,talk.politics.misc

"mr. parsli, i have to take exception at this.  there are verifiable, previous *examples* of levels of u.s. governments abusing gun-control restrictions.  i don't think it is paranoid to worry that what has been abused in the recent past might be abused in thye future.  after so many times of getting burned any sane person will stop putting his hand on the stove.          i'd love to.  but as long as the politicians grab power to sell pork back to their constituents, there's not a lot i can do.           it's silly to suggest that if there's anything we can't trust the government to do, and therefore the government should be allowed to do it, then we should change governments.  down that road lies total government power.   i've never been a fan of totalitarianism.          this is very likely.          the north american continent is not europe, no matter how many people would like it to be.  drugs are very illegal and they're here.  for years canada has crowed about its gun control.  if it is necessary to control guns over the whole continent, then canada should have always had comparable rates to the u.s., yet they still don't. unless you can tell me why the canadian border is so much more magical than the mexican border (which is shorter and far more heavily patrolled) then i really can't accept that argument.          no, there are approximately 31,000 deaths due to guns in the u.s., two-thirds of which are suicides.  (unfortunately i don't have suicide rates for norway.)  however, this makes the per-gun death rate about half the per-car death rate.         the problem's been humans since before we had stone axes.  the fct of the matter is simply this:  if nobody ever assaulted anybody, whether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totally irrelevent.        yet weapons are *built*.  i'd suggest, then, that the murderous impulse in humanity pre-dates weapons.        anyway, the bosnians et al. have been making an excellent attempt to kill each other for half a thousand years.  taking away their guns, even if we could, would neither halt the killing nor reduce the brutality.           in the u.s., approximately 60% of murders are commited with firearms. (50% with handguns, 10% with non-handguns.)  the reason i say that guns, per  se, are not the problem, is that our non-gun rate exceeds most of europe's countries *entire* violent crime rate.  i don't really think we've got more knives or fists.           in any case, i think examples of gun control *applied* to the u.s. have been abkect failures, just like drug prohibition and other forms of prohibition.  until you deal with *why* people are doing what they are doing, you won't solve your problem.  and if the problem is  violent crime, you shouldn't concentrate on the tools instead.  the *vast* majority of guns is never, ever misused.  (on the order of 99.5% over the entire lifetime of the gun).  this says to me that you can't make the argument that the gun itself causes the misuse.          the situation is not ""good"" in that people fear for their lives. but recall the scenes of the store-owners during the last riots, protecting their shops with guns.  would it have been better they, too, lost their livelihoods?          the problem of poverty and rage in los angeles, no it isn't. however, if that problem becomes a violent action, then yes, it can be appropriate.  whether or not some person has been hurt by their condition won't make me less dead if they burn down my house with me in it.         you have to examine which problem you're referring to.  if you're discussing someone violently assaulting you, then it is a perfectly legitimate response to make them stop.  (hopefully simply letting them know you're prepared to shoot them would be enough, as it was with the above-mentioned store-owners.)          45% of households have some form of firearm, usually a long gun. that accounts for a level of access for at least 100 million americans. firearm ownership is most likely among educated, well-off whites, the group *least* likely to be involved in violent crime.         you may take that for what it's worth.",16,talk.politics.guns

"[procedural note: ted directed followups to misc.legal only.  while i respect his right to do so, my own opinions are that (1) ""followup-to"" fields are mere suggestions, not mandatory commands and (2) this issue is of sufficient (a) general political relevance and (b) civil liberties interest to warrant keeping it active in t.p.m and a.s.c-l as well, at least for this round.]    okay, now here's my interpretation of _boomer_, based on the facts as presented in the new york court of appeals<*> holding (_boomer v.  <*>note: the new york court of appeals is the highest court in new york    state.  while the united states and 48 of the fifty states call their    highest court ""supreme court,"" ""supreme judicial court"" or ""supreme    court of appeals,"" maryland and new york call theirs simply the    ""court of appeals.""  to make matters worse, new york also calls its    _second-highest_ court the ""supreme court, appellate division""...  atlantic cement co._, 26 n.y.2d 219, 257 n.e.2d 870 (1970)):  oscar h. boomer, et al., owned land near the atlantic cement company's plant near albany, n.y.  (the fact pattern gives no information as to which came first, the plaintiff's acquisition of the land or he defendant's start of production at their cement plant.)  in the course of its regular operations, the cement plant did injury to the plaintiffs' property via dirt, smoke and vibrations emanating from the plant.  the plaintiffs sought injunctive relief -- that is, they asked the court to order atlantic cement to stop damaging their property.  (commentary: this seems entirely reasonable to me.  boomer at al owned their property and, presumably, a right to quiet enjoyment of it. atlantic cement's actions were depriving boomer et al of that right.)  instead of granting the plaintiffs' request for an injunction, the court ordered them to accept the damage being done to their property, provided that atlantic cement paid them $185,000 in compensatory damages.  in other words, the court granted atlantic cement co., a private party, the power and authority to _take_ the plaintiffs rights to quiet enjoyment of their property by eminent domain.  a taking by eminent domain is always problematical even when it's done by the state; allowing a private firm to do it is, in my opinion, totally wrong.  (yes, i know, the _boomer_ court didn't call it eminent domain.  but if it walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quacks like eminent domain...)  let me take issue with the way you've presented the case... you say that ""what happened in _boomer_ was that the judge didn't allow the plaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multi-million dollar plant to be shut down over $185,000 in damages.""  blackmail?      (pulls out black's law dictionary, abridged 5th edition....     ""blackmail: unlawful demand of money or property under threat to     do bodily harm, to injure property, to accuse of crime, or to expose     disgraceful defects.  this crime is commonly included under     extortion statutes."")  how do you define as ""blackmail"" one party's act of demanding the right to set its own sale price for a unique piece of property which it owns and which another party has expressed an interest in buying?  or of demanding the right not to sell that property at any price?  as i see it, boomer et al, having found themselves in the fortunate position of owning something which atlantic cement had to purchase if it wanted to stay in business, had every right in the world to set whatever price they wanted.  there isn't, or at least shouldn't be, any law that says that you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealings.  you go on to say: ""the plant would never have been shut down -- the plaintiff's lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement, because the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than $185k to having the plant shut down, while the plant would prefer any amount less than the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation.""  if so, so what?  since when are the courts supposed to be in the business of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements from other parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by those other parties?  if atlantic cement didn't want to have to face a choice between paying a windfall settlement or going out of business, well, shouldn't atlantic cement have thought of that before going _into_ business?  (i note that as far as the facts show boomer et al were _not_ the parties responsible for bringing about this situation -- that was atlantic cement's own fault for choosing to build and operate the type of plant they did where and when they did.)  and then you say: ""everyone's property rights were protected; the plaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were avoided."" as above, i dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were ""made whole."" they were, in fact, by court action deprived of their rights as owners of property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price acceptable to them.  and for that deprivation they were _not_ made whole.  and again i ask: since when are the courts supposed to be in the business of ensuring that ""unnecessary"" settlement costs are avoided? (if so, i've been miseducated -- i always thought that the courts were supposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)   (1) _boomer_ is not being taught as ""infamous,"" at least not at my school.  (aside: northeastern law usually does a very good job of hiring for their first-year, mandatory classes (such as torts, where i first encountered _boomer_) instructors who, regardless of their personal opinions, can and do teach the law neutrally.  when the students get into their second and third years, in which the students (a) can pick and choose which courses to take (except for the mandatory professional responsibility, of course) and (b) are presumed to be a bit more worldly and self-confident, less likely to be consciously or sub-consciously intimidated by law school professors and able to learn from openly biased instructors rather than be indoctrinated by them, the instructors tend to be more open in expressing their own opinions.  this is especially true of part-time instructors who, in real life, are practicing attorneys or sitting judges... this can be _very_ educational, sometimes far more so than being taught by a somewhat cloistered scholar.  end of aside.)  i called it infamous because that's my opinion of it.  for the reasons i've stated above, i believe it to be a triumph of something that i can only call ""economic correctness"" over justice.  (2) it is ""completely sensible"" only if you believe that the alleged right of the owners of atlantic cement to stay in business and avoid losing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and the alleged right of several hundred atlantic cement employees to not have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who own property which was damaged by atlantic cement's wrongful acts. (and if you believe that it is correct for the courts (or any other branch of government) to grant to private parties the right to take other people's property by eminent domain.)   really?  i didn't know that... what, if anything, has he had to say about cases like _boomer_?   i've admitted that my understanding of the field generally referred to as ""law and economics"" is weak.  if it advocates the use of economical analysis as one of many ""tie-breaker"" factors which courts may use to help them reach decisions in cases in which the dispute, as measured by the scale of ""justice"", is evenly balanced, fine.  but as illustrated by _boomer_, it is _not_ fine when the courts start viewing the economics of a case as being more important than the justice of a case.",18,talk.politics.misc

"paul's statement only asserts that that particular choice was not a matter of karmic fulfillment of the past, just as the fate of the man born blind (john 9) was not.  there is no question here of the simplistic idea of karma as a machine that is the sole determiner of one's destiny.  even the eastern traditions, or many of them, do not say that, as one knowledgeable poster pointed out.  and if in fact that paul did not know about or believe in reincarnation does not say anything one way or another about it.  even john the baptist, who jesus says emphatically is elijah (matt 11:14), does not appear to  have been aware of it, at least at the point at which he was asked. but  it is interesting that his threefold denial -- to the question whether  he is the christ, the prophet (i.e. isaiah), or elijah, is emphatic in  the first case and very weak in the third.  i would like to add once again that, while it is important to discuss the different passages that may point directly to the teaching of repeated earth lives, one way or another, what i really see as important in our time is that the subject be revisited in terms of the larger view of christianity and christian doctrine.  for the most part, those who do accept it either reject the central ideas of christianity or, if they are christians, hold their conviction as a kind of separate treasure. i believe that christianity has important new understanding to bring to bear on it, and vice versa, much that is central to christianity takes on entirely new dimensions of meaning in light of repeated earth lives. it has a direct bearing on many of the issues frequently discussed  in this newsgroup in particular.  i have said openly that i have developed my views of repeated earth lives largely from the work of rudolf steiner.  not that i hold him as an authority, but the whole picture of christianity becomes clearer in light of these ideas.  steiner indicated that the old consciousness of reincar- nation necessarily had to fade away that it could be renewed in later times, after a time of development of the christ idea through the first two millenia after christ's deed on golgotha.  in our own time, it becomes  important that, having received the basic gospel of salvation, our  understanding of life and of the human being can now grow to embrace the  significance of this idea.  for the discussions in this newsgroup, i  have tried to focus on that which can be related as directly as possible  to scripture and to fundamental christian teaching and tradition.",15,soc.religion.christian

"many pagans are involved in environmentalism--this is only natural, since respect for the earth is a fundamental tenet of all pagan denominations.  this doesn't mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace in the middle east is wrong because jews and muslims also work for it.    nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as christians should address this and look at what draws people from paganism to christianity.  like it or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that christianity should be, and isn't.     i believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that christianity has forgotten.  this doesn't mean that paganism is right, but it does mean that we have something to learn from the pagan movement.   first, paganism respects the feminine.  christianity has a long history of oppressing women, and many (if not most) male christians are still unable to live in a non-sexist manner.  the idea that god is sexless, or that christ  could have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a great deal of resistance.  this insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the  male-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who have had to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches.   second, paganism respects the physical world.  this is an idea with great ramifications.  one of these is environmentalism--respect for our surroundings and our world.  another is integration of sexuality.  christianity has a long tradition of calling all sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress and deny their sexuality.  this is too much--sex is clearly a part of human experience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option.   christianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic, and paganism is an attractive option.   i'm not advocating that christian doctrines (no sex before marriage, etc.) should be changed--just that christians work toward a more moderate ethic of sexuality.  denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated sexuality, and neither one does much to bring us closer to god.",15,soc.religion.christian

[some kinds might work better that others.]                 (2) divide the sample into two groups of equal weight                     and number.                 (3) sprout one group in distilled water on filter paper                     for three or four weeks.                 (4) separately incinerate both groups.                 (5) weigh the residue from each group.  [the residue of                     the sprouted group will usually weigh at least                     several percent more than the other group.]                 (6) analyze quantitatively the residue of each group for                     mineral content.

"sorry for posting this, but my e-mail keeps bouncing.  maybe it will help others here, anyway, and therefore i pray others will read this.  it is actually a response from my aunt, who has 5 kids, since i have none yet.       i'm posting this for a good christian relative who does not have e-mail access.  since this aunt and uncle have 5 kids i felt they would be more relevant than i, who have none (yet).       13-year-old (13yo) twins, 10yo boy, 6.5yo boy, 2yo girl       i don't call it spanking, but they do, so yes, very rarely.       i don't call it spanking because it's more of a reaction to something very dangerous, such as trying to stick their finger in a fan or running into the road.  maybe 3-4 times for each except for the 2yo girl, who has not been spanked yet.      they call it that because it *does* hurt their feelings, and of course i give all the hugs and stuff to ensure they know they're still loved.       no, that would be too painful.  if it's too traumatic they never recall why they were punished.  besides, it must be immediate, and taking the time to go get a toolmeans you're not doing it right away, and that lessens the impact.  it's very emotional for a child as it is - which is evidenced by the fact that a little slap on the rear - which hurts for perhaps 5 seconds - is called a spanking.      lots of logical consequences - for instance, when 4yo matthew dared a good friend to jump out of his treehouse or he would push him out, i made sure they didn't play together for 5 days so he'd know that would make him lose friends very quickly.  he's never done anything like that since.      we also use time-out in their rooms - i use a timer so they don't keep arguing with me over leaving, since it's hard to argue with a macine. i will go to the closed door and tell them timeout won't be over until they calm down if they're too tantrumy.  i use the top of the stairs when they're really young.       40       bath, ohio.  it's right outside of akron, in the northeast part of ohio.       no, and none of my kids would dream of it.  i hope you can use this to teach all parents that physical punishment isn't always required - parents use that as an excuse to hit too hard.       lots of timeouts, same as i use.  our family and my husband's have never used spankings.  in fact, my grandmother in law was one of 11 kids, and they were almost never spanked.  this was around the turn of the century.  and, none of us has ever been afoul of the law - man-made or god's law.      jesus says, referring to a small child whom he is holding, that ""what ye do to the least of these, ye do also to me.""  the bible also says in all things to be kind, and merciful, and especially loving. (colossians 3:12-15.) there is no room for selfish anger, which i'll admit i've been tempted with at times.  when i've felt like spanking hard in anger, maybe the kid deserved a little slap on the rear, but what i would have given would have been the devil's work.  i could feel the temptation, and just angrily ordered the kid to his/her room and went to my room myself.  after praying and asking god's forgiveness, i was much calmer, and did not feel like spanking, but felt that what i had done was enough punishment.",15,soc.religion.christian
"(excerpts from posting on this topic)    (i've seen satellites at midnight - they're not only in twilight.) :o)    now my comments:   i'd like to add that some of the ""protests"" do not come from a strictly  practical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for  research activities by professional astronomers.  some of what i  would complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  many readers may  never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred -  unsullied by the actions of humans.  the space between the stars  as profoundly black as an abyss can be.  with full horizons and  a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time  - none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man.  any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.   whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there  and becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief  in an afterlife.    the space age changed all that.  the effect of the first sputniks  and echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  to see a light  crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people  is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating  the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or  thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.   but there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky.   yes, i know aircraft are almost always in sight.  i have to live  in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport  currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  the  impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists  that has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped  into shape by the hands of man.  in some places the only life  forms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels  (or rats).  i visited some friends up in the appalacian mountains  one weekend, ""getting away from it all"" (paved roads, indoor plumbing,  malls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then i quickly noticed  the hollow was directly under the main flight path into dulles - 60-80  miles to the east.  (their 'security light' didn't help matters  much either.)  but i've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of  high air traffic.  so i know the skies are rarely perfect.   but there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't  fouled in some way.  (i mean they've been trying this forever -  like, concerning tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!)  i don't watch  commercial television, but i can imagine just how disgusting beer,  truck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.   if ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at  least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.    to be open about this though, i have here my listing of the passage  of hst in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight friday at  8:25 p.m. edt it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the  local meridian from baltimore vicinity.  i'll be trying to see it  if i can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  so i suppose i could  be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky  while complaining about billboards proposed by others.  be that  as it may, i think my point about a desire for beauty is valid,  even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved.",14,sci.space

"folks,  it's time to start building some precise questions to send to our federal elected officials and to investigative reporters in our local tv, radio and newprint media.  ideally, these questions could be asked at any investigation into the batf's and fbi's participation at the waco fiasco in hopes of being resolved and, hopefully, wake up the local news media that they are not getting the entire truth from the batf and fbi.  my list is up to 13 that are really nagging  at my gut.  the list will probably grow.   1.   what were the contents of the original warrant, now sealed, that      the batf obtained?  2.   it is reasonable to believe that illegal firearms and/or ammunition      could not be flushed down the toilet.  therefore, a ""no-knock""      raid could be ruled out.  prior to the initial assault on the       complex, did a single batf agent and accompanying witness (without       a contingent of assault and news media personnel) attempt to knock       on the door of the branch davidian's complex and serve the warrant       in a manner prescribed by law?  3.   on the day of the initial assault on the complex, batf agents      were aware that several small children were inside the buildings.      in the ensueing gun battle, batf agents fired into a building      known to contain children, killing at least one two-year old child.      knowing children were present, why didn't the batf have an      alternate plan and immediately retreat from the area close to      the complex and implement the alternate plan rather than opening      fire and jeopardizing the lives of the children in the building?   4.   the fbi spokesman states that paper evidence indicates that      david koresh and members of the branch davidians possessed over      $200,000 in firearms and ammunition.  did david koresh and the      members of the branch davidians have a valid federal firearms      license, were they actively participating in the legal business      of selling/buying firearms and ammunition, and were any of the      weapons they had illegally possessed?  does this paper evidence      consist only of weapons purchased or does it include legally      dispossessed weapons.  5.   after the original assault on the compound tragically failed,      a batf spokeswoman stated ""we were outgunned!"".  yet, tv newscasts      of video tape filmed at the time of the incident show batf agents      armed with mp-5 and ar-15/m16 rifles.  although unclear on the      video tape because of obstruction from full view by agent's      bodies, they also may have had ak-47 and sks rifles.  what type(s)      of firearms did the batf agents have immediate access to at the       scene of the original assault on the complex?  6.   since there is no evidence to confirm anyone was inside the      complex involuntarily, why did the fbi treat it as a ""hostage""      situation?   7.   along the same lines, why did the fbi use ""psychological warfare""      techniques, including sensory overload, sleep deprivation, and      other disruptive techniques that would test the sanity of any       normal person rather than using techniques aimed at placing the       complex occupants into a calmer frame of mind?  8.   reports indicate several of the children inside the complex      were accompanied by their mothers.  since it is reasonable      to expect these mothers would have their children taken away      from them if they came out, why did the fbi expect the mothers      to just walk out and surrender themselves to the authorities?  9.   agents at the scene claim to have seen members of the branch      davidians setting fire to the complex.  branch davidian members      who survived the inferno claim the fire was started when an       armored vehicle punched through the wall and knocked over a       lantern which was setting on a table.  video tape of the incident       does show an armored vehicle punching a hole in the wall and the       fire erupted almost immediately from the same general location.        was the source of the fire the same room where the armored vehicle       penetrated?  10.  fbi spokesmen are voicing the opinion that the david koresh and      the members of the branch davidians committed mass suicide.  yet,      bodies are being discovered throughout the house and other areas      within the building complex.  this seems to be counter to any      known mass suicides through history.  what evidence does the fbi      have that a mass suicide pact existed?  11.  fbi director sessions stated that the massive fireball shown on      the video tape was caused by the branch davidian's ammunition      and/or powder cache exploding.  yet, the fireball seems to be      more characteristic of the type created when compressed gas      or other highly volatile fuel source explodes.  was any evidence       found which would indicate the branch davidians had an ammunition       and/or powder cache which exploded to create this fireball?  if so,      and if david koresh and members of the branch davidians were       engaged in the legal business of selling/buying firearms, was the      amount determined to be excessively greater than one would expect      for someone engaged in such a legal business?  12.  it is rumored that one fbi agent was extremely upset about critical      news media coverage and intentionally used an armored vehicle to      crush a reporter's car which had been left at the compound.  is       there any factual basis to this rumor and, if so, what charges will       be brought against the fbi agent who performed the act?  13.  fbi director sessions states that, during the final assault on the      complex, ""over 80 shots were fired at the vehicles.""  on the video      tape of the incident, you can hear the drone of the armored vehicles      engines.  yet, there is no sound of the sharp reports that one      would expect to hear if shots were fired.  also, there are no       indications of smoke and/or muzzle flashes appearing from the windows,      buildings or other structures in the video.  surely, these should be       evident if the branch davidians had fired on the armored vehicles.        finally, the video tape does not show any indication of paint splatter,       sparks or other characteristic spray of material which should be       apparent if the branch davidians had fired upon the vehicles.  do       any of the armored vehicles which were brought in to pump tear gas       into the compound show evidence of fresh damage due to being hit by       shots from high-power rifles?  14.  cs gas is considered to be a chemical warfare agent.  the united      states has signed international treaties which prevent the use      of cs gas in warfare.  if the united states could not morally use      cs gas against saddam hussein and his troops, why is it morally      acceptable to use the same agent against citizens of our own land?  15.  on april 21, fbi spokesmen state that at least 3 bodies discovered      in the complex had bullet wounds to the head indicating they had      been murdered or had committed suicide.  on april 22, the county      coroner claims he knows nothing about any bodies found with bullet      wounds to the head.  were any of the victims bodies found within      the burned out complex have bullet wounds to the head?",16,talk.politics.guns

"well, yes and no.  i don't particularly want this discussion to spark a lengthy debate, but i do think it's worth pointing out that ""popular usage"" is not always sufficient excuse.    in this case, for example, i think an appropriate parallel may be found in the pronunciation of proper names: if people commonly misspelled or  mispronounced your name, would you feel compelled to change it?  probably not.    the same is true of x.  ""the x window system"", ""x"", ""x11"", and related monickers are proper names in the same sense that any product name is a proper name.  in fact, some of them are *trademarked* names.  the fact  that many people get them wrong is largely beside the point.    as for the trade publications that promulgate things like ""x window"" or ""x.windows"" or any of the other nonsensical variants one often sees,  consider the fact that these publications are supposedly written by  *journalists*.  would you trust the facts of a journalist who couldn't be bothered to get the name of his/her source right?  would you trust a product review by someone who got the name of the product wrong?  popular usage is as it may be, but i for one am all for holding people who claim to be journalists to a higher standard of correctness.",5,comp.windows.x
"you're reading far too much into this (aside from the obvious fact that you shouldn't hold anybody to what they wrote in a 10 year old book in a rapidly changing field like this.)   quite simply she says that the security should not depend on the secrecy of the algorithm.  a secret algorithm can still be secure, after all, we just don't know it.  only our level of trust is affected, not the security of the system.  the algorithm *could* be rsa for all we know, which we believe to be secure.  they have a much better reason to classify the algorithm than to protect its security.  they want to protect its market share.  if they publish the algorithm, then shortly manufacturers would make chips that implement the algorithm and standard but do not use a key stored in escrow.  and of course, everybody would buy them.   the whole push of this chip is that by establishing a standard that you can only use if you follow their rules, they get us to follow their rules without enacting new laws that we would fight tooth and nail.  quite simply, with clipper established, it would be much harder for another encryption maker to define a new standard, to make phones that can't talk to the leading phone companies.   the result is tappable cryptography without laws forbidding other kinds, for 99% of the populace.   to get untappable crypto, you would have to build a special phone that runs on top of this system, and everybody you talk to would have to have an indentical one.  that's the chicken and egg of crypto.  the government is using its very special ability to solve chicken and egg problems of new technologies to control this one in a way they like.   it's almost admirably clever.  when the eff started, i posed the question here ""what are the police going to do when they wake up and discover they can't wiretap?"" and nobody here had an answer (or even thought it was much of a question)  then came the backdoor and digital telephony bills, which we fought.  now we have their real answer, the cleverest of all.",11,sci.crypt

"ds>from: viking@iastate.edu (dan sorenson)   ds>>riding up the hill leading to my ds>>house, i encountered a liver-and-white springer spaniel (no relation to ds>>the springer softail, or the springer spagthorpe, a close relation to ds>>the spagthorpe viking).  ds>        i must have missed the article on the spagthorpe viking.  was ds>that the one with the little illuminated dragon's head on the front ds>fender, a style later copied by indian, and the round side covers?  no. not at all. the viking was a trick little unit made way back when (forties? fifties?) when spag was trying to make a go of it in racing. the first iteration (the springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to max friz's famous design, but with an overhead ""point cam"" (see below for more on the valvetrain). the problem was that the thing had no ground clearance whatsoever. the solution was to curve the cylinder bores, so that the ground clearance was substantially increased:         ==@==   <-springer motor (front)                  viking motor (front) ->   \=@=/  this is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curved around a radius, as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turn in the middle of their stroke. the engine also had curved connecting rods to accomodate the stroke.  the engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and still unique) overhead cam system. through the use of clever valve timing and and extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe was required to drive both overhead valves.  just as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used a pressurized stream of oil to power the ""waterwheel"" which kept the lobe spinning over. one side effect that required some rather brutal engineering fixes was that until the engine's oil pressure came up to normal, the engine's valve timing would be more or less random, resulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. the solution was a little hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the beast, remarkably similar to the system used in new porsches to pressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however, uses an electric oil pump. wimps).  despite this fix, the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively firing its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily lose a bit of oil pressure in a corner. the solution was to run even higher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. this was feasible because it was a racing engine.  with just a single overhead lobe, and no pushrod/shaft/chain towers because of the hydraulic system, the head of the engine came to an almost perfect point:                      /\                    /()\   <-lobe                   / xx \  <-complex linkage (not shown due to  valvestems ->   / \  / \    complexity)                 |  |   | |                 |  |===| |                     =0=  <---piston                      |                              note that the tip was not truly vertical                              (it was at about a 70 degree angle to the                              ground, and this drawing doesn't show the                              curvature because there was none in the                              head itself. the bore curve would start                              about where the cylinder bore disappears in                              this diagram   the effect of the pointy heads on top of a pair of gently (pundits of the day even said sensuously) curved cylinders was much like a pair of finned viking horns poking out from beneath the gas tank. thus, the name.  the vik was a moderately successful racer, lightning fast when it worked, but plagued by problems relating to its revolutionary technology. eventually, it was dumped when spag finally realized that racing was not where the spagthorpe name would be made. the machines were raced for another year or two by privateers, and their fate (approximately six vikings were made, plus one or possibly two springers. confusing the issue is one old spag staffer who swears up and down that this machine was tooled for production, and that as many as twenty or thirty machines may have come off the line. however, no modern record of a production viking has survived, and most motorcycle historians discount this story.  ryan cousinetc.|1982 yamaha vision xz550 -black pig of inverness|live to ride kotrb          |1958 ajs 500 c/s -king rat                      |to work to dod# 0863      |i'd be a squid if i could afford the bike...    |flame to ryan.cousineau@compdyn.questor.org  |   vancouver, bc, canada   |live . . .    * slmr 2.1a * if you aren't sliding, you aren't riding.",8,rec.motorcycles

"i think this is a weak argument.  the fact is, there are *two* references to jesus in _antiquities of the jews_, one of which has unquestionably at least been altered by christians.  origen wrote, in the third century, that josephus did not recognize jesus as the messiah, while the long passage says the opposite.  there is an arabic manuscript of _antiquities of the jews_ which contains a version of the passage which is much less gung-ho for jesus and may be authentic.    there is no question that origen, in the third century, saw a reference to jesus in josephus.  there are no manuscripts of _antiquities_ which lack the references.  it is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted, but i don't think it's very likely--nor do i think there is a consensus in the scholarly community that this is the case.

"ok, as one last attempt, i'll take a different tack.  we all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for why one can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle. the question is, is one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? the idea would be to design an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, and see which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of us who have bikes are familiar.  let's look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on its own, gyroscopic precession. to examine this alone, we would have to get rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patches to transmit any force. the wheels and steering mechanism would have to remain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike, through suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the same way) similar to a bikes. an experiment would be to ride a bike along  a dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change  surfaces to something that won't transmit forces through the contact  patches, and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. it  probably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice,  but we wouldn't get a good idea of how well or what it feels like  because, without the contact patches, we can't turn.  maybe there's a  better way. besides, even ice doesn't get rid of the contact patch forces altogether, so we'd have to find a really frictionless surface. you'd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it was the rotation that did it.  looking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple. now we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and direction of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits them about the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels. how it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we're just looking for something that has contact patches that can go straight and not sideways, and skis or skates would do fine. i don't know of any snow-ski or skate bikes, but up here we have the suzuki wetbike that is arranged like a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels. i think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something like that, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect. now i admit that this is second hand info (although i'd love to try one of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in a bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very much like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn. so we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike's, a similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do have countersteering.  conclusion: you don't need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have motorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. we still don't know what real effect the gyroscopes have when they're there, but from my observations of how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, i'm  willing to bet that they're not the dominant factor in countersteering.   if you don't like this conclusion, then don't accept it, but my motorcycle's behaviour is consistent with it. if someone can prove otherwise, go ahead.",8,rec.motorcycles

"indeed, the immediate context [nasb] is:    26 otherwise, he would have needed to suffer often   since the foundation of the world; but now once at   the consummation he has been manifested to put away    sin by the sacrifice of himself.    27 and inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die   once, and after this comes judgement;    28 so christ also, having been offered once to bear   the sins of many, shall appear a second time, not to   bear sin, tro those who eagerly await him.   the first point is that this verse is part of an even larger context, the subject of which is not the destiny of the individual human soul but rather the singular nature of christ's sacrifice, ""once"", and the fulfillment of the law for all of fallen  mankind.  rudolf frieling elaborates this in detail in his  ""christianity and reincarnation"".  the thrust of the passage in its context is to liken the one time incarnation and  sacrifice of christ for all mankind to the individual  experience of the human being after death.  the ""once""  is repeated and emphasized, and it highlights the singularity  of christ's deed.  one thing for certain it does is to  refute the claims of some that christ incarnates more than  once.  but the comparison to the human experience - die  once, then judgement (note: not ""the judgement"", but just  ""judgement"".  the word for judgement is ""krisis"".  hebrews 9:27 is the one passage most often quoted in defense of the doctrine that the bible denies reincarnation.  at this point, i would just emphasize again that the  passages  that (arguably) speak against it are few, and that invariably they are talking about something eles, and the apparent denial of reincarnation is either inferred, or, as in the case of hebrews, taken literally and deposited into an implied context, namely a doctrine of the destiny of the human being after death.  what should be considered seriously is that the bible is essentially silent about the fate of the individual human being between death and the last day.  if you take the few passages that could possibly be interpreted to mean a single earth life, they are arguable.  and there are other passages that point, arguably, in the other direc- tion. such as matthew 11:14 and john 9:2.  we can continue to debate the individual scraps of scripture that might have a bearinig on this, and indeed we should discuss them. but what i wanted to introduce into the discussion was an approach to the idea of repeated earth lives that, unlike hindu, buddhist and ""new age"" teachings, takes full cognizance of the divinity, singular incarnation, death, burial, resurrection, and second coming of christ as the savior of mankind; the accountability of each individual for his deeds and the reality of the fall and of sin and its consequences; the redemption of man from sin through christ; the resurrection of the body, and the last judgement.  taken in this larger sense, many serious questions take on an entirely different perspective.  e.g. the destiny of those who died in their sins before christ came. the relationship of faith and grace to  works, the meaning of ""deathbed conversion"", the meaning of the sacraments, and many other things.  not that i propose to answer all those questions by a simple doctrine of convenience, but only that the discussion takes on a different dimension, and in my opinion one that is truly worthy of both man, the earth, and their creator and  redeemer. there are many deep questions that continue to be deep, such  as the meaning of the second death, and how the whole of christian doctrine would apply to this larger perspective of human existence.  there are those who deeply believe that the things of which the bible  does not speak are not things we should be concerned with.  but christ also indicated that there were other things that we would come to know in the future, including things that his disciples (and therefore others)  could not bear yet.  this idea that the human capacity for growth in knowledge, not only of the individual in one lifetime, but of the whole of humanity, also takes on great meaning when we realize that our growth in the spirit is a long term process.  the bible was not meant to codify all spiritual knowledge in one place forever, but to proclaim the gospel of the incarnation and redeeming deed of christ - taking the gospel in the greater context, from genesis to revelation.  now, salvation (healing) becomes,  not the end of man's sojourn but its beginning.  and the last judgement and the new heaven and earth that follow it become its fulfullment.",15,soc.religion.christian

"golly, i love stupid people. :-) listen, rex, this is hockey.  the nhl, to be precise.  and in the nhl, there exist these things called ""ties"".  a tie occurs when a game ends with the score for each team equal.  each team gets one point for a tie.  there also exits these things called ""wins"".  a win is when one team has a higher score than the opponent.  (oh yeah, only two teams play each other at a time, so i can say ""the opponent"".)  a team gets two points for a win.  so, let's say that a team has a record of 38 wins, 36 losses, and 10 ties.  another team has a record of 40 wins, 38 losses and 6 ties.  the first team has (38*2)+10 = 86 points.  the second team has (40*2)+6 = 86 points.  wow!  they *both* have the same number of points, but the number of wins is different!  how did they do that??!?!?!?!  that's amazing.  so, rex, when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker, well, then that's what it means.  in our example, the second team would win the tiebreaker and therefore have the ""better"" record, even though both teams had the same number of points.  if you didn't understand this post, rex, maybe you should go back and read it again, very slowly. :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)  --     keith keller				let's go rangers!!!!! 						let's go quakers!!!!! 	kkeller@mail.sas.upenn.edu		ivy league champs!!!!",10,rec.sport.hockey

"the article that follows was taken from the wednesday, april 14, 1993 issue of usa today (""drug use up at younger age"" by mike snider, p. 1a).      drug use is on the rise among kids as young as eighth graders -     usually 13 - and they're using more lsd and inhalants like glue     and air fresheners, says a new survey.      the annual national high school senior survey on drug abuse finds     ""statistically significant increases"" in eighth-graders' use of     many drugs, including marijuana, cocaine, crack, lsd and inhalants.      ""we may be in danger of losing some ... hard-won ground (in reducing     drug use) as a new, more naive generation of youngsters enters     adolescence,"" says lloyd johnston, university of michigan, chief     researcher on the study sponsored by the department of health and     human services.      but drug use among high school seniors is continuing a decade-long     decline.      the study of 50,000 students shows the percentage who tried the     following in the 30 days before they were polled:          * 8th-graders  - alcohol 26%; cigarettes 16%; marijuana 4%;                          cocaine 0.7%.          * 10th-graders - alcohol 40%; cigarettes 22%; marijuana 8%;                          cocaine 0.7%.          * 12th-graders - alcohol 51%; cigarettes 28%; marijuana 12%;                          cocaine 1.3%.      among 12th-graders, use of marijuana, cocaine and inhalants     declined over the year before.  not so with lsd.      * 2% of eighth-graders have tried lsd in the last year, up 24%     over 1991.       * use of lsd among seniors is at its highest point since 1982; 6%     tried it in the last year.      reducing drug use among students ""requires a different kind of     strategy"" that health secretary donna shalala says will be part     of an overall illness prevention plan.      the survey shows drugs are easier to get and fewer eighth-graders     disapprove of them.

good i had a bad feeling about this problem because of a special case with no solution that worried me.  four coplanar points in the shape of a square have no unique sphere  that they are on the surface of. similarly 4 colinear point have no finite sized sphere that they are on the surface of.  these algorithms being geometrical designed rather than algebraically design meet these problems neatly.  when determining which plane the 3 points are on if they are colinear the algorithm should afil or return infinite r. when intersecting the two lines there are 2 possibilities they are the same line  (the 4 points were on a planar circle) they are different lines but parallel. there is a sphere of in radius.  this last case can be achieved with 3 colinier points and any 4th point by taking the 4th point and pairs of the first 3 parallel lines will be produced  it can also be achieved by  if all 4 points are coplanar but are not on one circle.   it seems to me that the algorithm only fails when the 4 points are coplanar. the algorithm always fails when the points are coplanar. (4 points being colinear => coplanar)  testing if the 4th point is coplanar when the plane of the first 3 points has been found is trivial.,1,comp.graphics
"from what i read, the other fellow told salameh how to put it together over the phone.  the bomb was supposedly some sort of sophisticated type, so to put a (i assume complicated) sophisticated bomb together from instructions _over the phone_ (!) one must need some brains i would expect.    i read this in an article in ""the australian muslim times"", the newspaper (weekly) of the australian muslim community.    if this is true, perhaps one of the muslims based in north america (if they see this posting) can elaborate.       i don't deny this fact.  the thrust of my argument here is that   (a) salameh is, according to us law, innocent as he has not been found guilty in a court of law.  as his guilt has not been established, it is wrong for people to make postings based on this assumption.  (b) islam teaches us _not_ to harm innocents.  if muslims -- who perhaps have not realized that islam teaches this -- perform such actions, it is _not_ _because_ of the teachings of islam, but rather _in spite of_ and _in contradiction to_ the  teachings of islam.  this is an important  distinction.  i should clarify what muslims usually mean when they say ""muslim"".  in general, anyone who calls themselves a ""muslim"" and does not do or  outwardly profess something in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of islam is considered to be a muslim.  thus, one who might do things contrary to islam (through ignorance, for example) does not suddenly _not_ become a muslim.  if one knowingly transgresses islamic teachings and essential principles, though, then one does leave islam.  the term ""muslim"" is to be contrasted with ""mu'min"", which means ""true believer"".  however, whether a muslim is in reality a mu'min is something known only by god (and perhaps that person himself).  so you will not find the term mu'min used very much by muslims in alt.atheism, because it is not known to anybody (except myself and god), whether i, for example, am a ""true believer"" or not.  for example, i could just be putting on a show here, and in reality believe something opposite to what i write here, without anyone knowing.  thus, when we say ""muslims"" we mean all those who outwardly profess to follow islam, whether in practice they might, in ignorance, transgress islamic teachings.  by ""muslim"" we do not necessarily mean ""mu'min"", or ""true believer"" in islam.",0,alt.atheism

"i think that you are changing the meaning of ""values"" here. perhaps it is time to backtrack and take a look at the word.  value n. 1. a fair equivalent or return for something, such as goods or service. 2. monetary or material worth. 3. worth as measured in  usefulness or importance; merit. 4. a principle, standard, or quality considered inherently worthwhile or desirable. 5. precise meaning, as of a word. 6. an assigned or calculated numerical quantity. 7. mus.  the relative duratation of a tone or rest. 8. the relative darkness or lightness of a color. 9. the distinctive quality of a speech or speech sound.   in context of a moral system, definition four seems to fit best. in terms of scientific usage, definitions six or eight might apply. note that these definitions do not mean the same thing.  in my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a reach. science has its basis in observable fact. even the usages of the word ""value"" above do not denote observable fact, but rather a standard of measurement. i would conclude that science does not have its basis in values, and so your statement above fails. in fact, if one concludes that a scientific set of measurements (values) are based on systems derived from observation, then it must follow that in a scientific context, there is no such thing as there is no such thing as ""objective values.""  back to the present. this has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow. just because the word ""values"" is used in both contexts does not mean that there is a relationship between the two contexts.  if one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. considering the meaning of the word ""objective"" i doubt that this will ever happen.  so, back to the original question:  and objective morality is.....?  if you can provide an objective foundation for ""morality"" then that will be a good beginning.",19,talk.religion.misc

"i agree with you harry, however you must also concede then that arab terrorism is also a tragedy of war.  remember that the palestinians have no other effective target but civilians in order to further their cause.  if irgun had to attack civilian targets to terrorize in order that they might obtain some objective, i'm sure they would have done so.  i also don't exclude irgun's action against british soldiers as terrorism. the british were showing signs of favoring a compromise with regards to palestine, and the irgun and branch off groups made a point to kill young british recruits so that mothers and fathers back in britain would get angry at britains continued presence in palestine.  sounds like a form of terrorism to me, and not much removed from arab terrorism.  we must not also forget that irgun, or irgun branch off groups [more likely] killed many jews who were not as hardline zionist as they, or who cooperated with the british.   	i'll reiterate again.... both sides are screwy, but i'll favor the underdog in this case because i do think they were a bit screwed.",17,talk.politics.mideast

"note:  i'm not posting this as part of an argument with roger meynard, but as an independent sort of thread.  i do actually quote some things that roger meynard wrote, but it might be better to think of this as ""sampling"" his post (in the hip-hop sense) because it fits in with what i want to say.   there's an interesting parallel between this way of viewing a baseball team and some people's conception of a biological organism.  in the biology context, we would very likely read ""fitness"" for ""the score of the game"" and ""organisms"" for ""teams"".  how we interpret ""players"" is trickier, but either ""organs"", or ""genes"" might seem reasonable choices depending on what point we were trying to make.  a ""genes"" interpretation actually might be really interesting in this case,  but that would be a different and probably longer post.  if, however, we take the ""organ"" view, then our knowledge of biology should make us pause before we start saying things like ""species x is more fit than species y because of a better organ z"".  given what we know about the interdependence of organs, we would often be suspicious of such claims.  (but note that this type of argument is quite often made when you map ""species x"" onto 'humans', and ""organ z"" onto 'brain').  on the other hand, some statements of this kind do seem more reasonable than others, as far as we can test them (e.g. 'brain' above might be more reasonable than 'pancreas' assuming no gross pathology, particularly if species y is a primate).  even when you make such statements, you should be concerned with the functioning of the whole organism, and the possibility that one organ might be more crucial for one species and a second organ in another. (not to mention the possibility that no organ is particularly crucial in some third species.)  however, if we are non-vitalists with any kind of reductionsit streak, we will want to say that an organism is not some completely magical unanalyzable ""whole"" but an intriguing process made up of various subprocesses that interact in ways that are potentially observable.  some of these processes might be localized to particular organs, while others may be distributed across multiple organs.  in a way, this is just like a baseball team, except that i think it is pretty clear that the processes and interactions involved in baseball are *much* simpler and less numerous than in most organisms.   one thing that is quite difficult about baseball is that perfectly controlled experiments are sometimes very tough to do.  but, of course, this has never stopped researchers from doing the best they can, and sometimes deriving very powerful conclusions even in the absence of certainty.  most of this goes far beyond sheer speculation, but even sheer speculation can motivate further interesting research.   in this cases, we're seeing the word ""statistics"" means ""summary of observed events"", where the events themselves can be viewed as the output of some process, and possibly inputs for other processes. thus, if we have any valid notion of how the processes are put together into the functioning organism, data in the form of statistics might give us a basis to test particular hypotheses.   this statement brings us back to the concept of fitness again. fitness is defined in terms of both an organism and its environment; you might be fit in one situation and not another.  moving to baseball, it is clear that each team spends the entire season in an environment including all the other teams in the league.  in at least a nominal sense, the division winners are the fittest teams in the league, in that they (on average) had better fitness scores than any of their competing opponennts.  but in a real sense, there is a fairly large random component in the performance of each team that is difficult if not impossible to account for in terms of factors intrinsic to (or interesting for) baseball.  the same is true in biology.  but here is also no direct biological equivalent of the world series in basebal.  in the world series, the random component may be greatly magnified by the small number of games that are played, and both teams suddenly experience huge changes from the environement where they were originally successful.  it might be fun to watch, but it's unclear what it all really means.  ***  now just one more un-related point:   on the other hand, you have seen some of us who can predict the outcome of the divisional races better than a random assignment of teams to finishes, and maybe some of us (e.g. me) who can do this better than the other participants in this forum on a regular basis. but this is probably only due to the fact that a 162-game schedule gives you a little hope that bad hops aren't the only difference between the winners and the losers.  moreover, you've had the opportunity to see some analysis of the world series situation that makes the strong claim that *nobody* can predict the ws winner with reliably greater accuracy than a coin biased only to reflect the well-known home vs. road effect on winning percentage.   since stats are summaries of events, it's true that if you know the events you can derive the stats.  but if somebody is trying to understand the process behind the stats, then the stats produce new knowledge, and some of this might even be reliable, repeatable, and useful.  speaking of which, i should get back to producing knowledge in a different field.  that is, of course, if i can produce knowledge even though i'm relying on stats to do it.",9,rec.sport.baseball

"sterrenkundig symposium 'compacte objecten'                                              op 26 april 1993   in het jaar 1643, zeven jaar na de oprichting van de universiteit van utrecht, benoemde de universiteit haar eerste sterrenkundige waarnemer. hiermee ontstond de tweede universiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld. aert jansz, de eerste waarnemer, en zijn opvolgers voerden de utrechtse sterrenkunde in de daaropvolgende jaren, decennia en eeuwen naar de voorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek. dit jaar is het 350 jaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond.  de huidige generatie utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten sterrenkunde, verenigd in het sterrekundig instituut utrecht, vieren de benoeming van hun 'oervader' middels een breed scala aan feestelijke activiteiten. zo is er voor scholieren een planetenproject, programmeert de studium generale een aantal voordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de dies natalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt. er staat echter meer op stapel.  studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan een sterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. de onderwerpen van het symposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het huidige utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten 'compacte objecten', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren. bij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de deelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van de stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. in de eerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. lamers een beknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren, waarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens een half uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten zullen ingaan. na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tot het stellen van vragen. het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt op een apart vel. het niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaars studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde. ook andere belangstellenden zijn van harte welkom!  tijdens de lezing van prof. kuijpers zullen, als alles goed gaat, de veertien radioteleskopen van de radiosterrenwacht westerbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussen het heelal, westerbork en utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal van een snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren, een zogeheten pulsar, in de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren. prof. kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen (elkaar snel opvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling) bespreken en trachten te verklaren. het slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met de technische haalbaarheid ervan. de op te vangen signalen zijn namelijk zo zwak, dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10 miljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30 watt een seconde te laten branden! tijdens het symposium zal er niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden: de hedendaagse technologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren.  deelname aan het symposium kost f 4,- (exclusief lunch) en f 16,- (inclusief lunch). inschrijving geschiedt door het verschuldigde bedrag over te maken op abn-amro rekening 44.46.97.713 t.n.v. stichting 350 jus. het gironummer van de abn-amro bank utrecht is 2900. bij de inschrijving dient te worden aangegeven of men lid is van de nnv. na inschrijving wordt de symposiummap toegestuurd. bij inschrijving na 31 maart vervalt de mogelijkheid een lunch te reserveren.  het symposium vindt plaats in transitorium i, universiteit utrecht.  voor meer informatie over het symposium kan men terecht bij henrik spoon, p/a s.r.o.n., sorbonnelaan 2, 3584 ca utrecht. tel.: 030-535722. e-mail: henriks@sron.ruu.nl.    ******* dagprogramma **************************************    9:30   ontvangst met koffie & thee  10:00   opening            prof. dr. h.j.g.l.m. lamers (utrecht)  10:10   dubbelster evolutie            prof. dr. h.j.g.l.m. lamers  10:25   radiopulsars            prof. dr. j.m.e. kuijpers (utrecht)  11:00   pulsars in dubbelster systemen            prof. dr. f. verbunt (utrecht)  11:50   massa & straal van neutronensterren            prof. dr. j. van paradijs (amsterdam)  12:25   theorie van accretieschijven            drs. r.f. van oss (utrecht)  13:00   lunch  14:00   hoe zien accretieschijven er werkelijk uit?            dr. r.g.m. rutten (amsterdam)  14:35   snelle fluktuaties bij accretie op neutronensterren         en zwarte gaten            dr. m. van der klis (amsterdam)  15:10   thee & koffie  15:30   zwarte gaten: knippen en plakken met ruimte en tijd            prof. dr. v. icke (leiden)  16:05   afsluiting  16:25   borrel",14,sci.space

": i heard on the radio today about a christian student conference where : christians were called to ""repent"" of america's ""national"" sins, such : as sexual promiscuity. :  : to which i reply: ...whoa there! :  : how can i repent of _someone else's_ sin?   i can't. :  : and when i claim to ""repent"" of someone else's sin, am i not in fact : _judging_ him?  jesus equipped us to judge activities but warned us : not to judge people.

(some church members would be much more judgmental, but that is *their* problem.)  in situations where welfare assistance is  provided through our church, bishops usually require that the family be making some effort to live the gospel standards and provide for  themselves.  however, there are occasions when assistance is provided because of the children in the home. as a former bishop of mine said, ""children are  always worthy before god.""   i am not sure what you mean by the term ""bastards"" in this context.  latter-day saints believe that through the temple ordinances the family unit may be preserved in eternity.  if you use genealogical material or software produced by the church, you may notice a section for ""temple ordinances.""  within that section there should be a spot for signifying ""bic"" which stands for ""born in the covenant.""  the children born to couple sealed (married) within the temple are ""born in the covenant"" and are eligible to be part of that eternal family unit. children born to other couples (whether in a civil marriage or not) would have to be sealed to their parents after their marriage is solemnized for eternity.  supposing a child were born to a woman out of wedlock, he or she could be sealed to his or her parents at a later date or adopted into  any eternal family unit (which may include one of the birth parents).   i can't say if this principle of adoption was revealed at the same time as the sealing  ordinances, but it has been accepted for the  ~15 years i have been in the church.  i would tend to discount any admonitions from the church authorities against having children out of wedlock because even though there are provisions within the lord's plan to recover what we have done wrong the church does not want to give anyone the impression we can sin and repent at our leisure.",15,soc.religion.christian

"a few comments on the atf's botched handling of this case:  1. attempting to storm the compound in broad daylight?  the explanation    we were given (at least at one point) was that they thought the cult    members would be at religious services.  my only comment on this bit    of idiocy is that if you're going to operate as a quasi-military unit,    you'd better understand basic military tactics.  one cardinal rule    is that only a fool plans an operation where if one assumption is    incorrect, the operation will fail disastrously.  2. we were told that atf got four agents killed because they were    outgunned, they didn't expect such heavy resistance.  when    questioned about why such an overwhelming military-style assault    was planned, we were told that it was because the cultists were    thought to be heavily armed.  can you say contradictory?  i knew    you could!  3. the batf has had a bad reputation for years as a bunch of arrogant,    hotdoggers.  i was talking to relatives a couple of weeks ago and    referred to them as a bunch of crockett and tubbs wannabes.  i'm    more than ever convinced that's right on target.  an anecdote not    related to the waco fiasco is that apparently the batf screwed up    some of the evidence in the world trade center bombing.  there's    now an excellent chance some of the forensic evidence gathered by    the fbi will not be admissible in court.  this is not hearsay.  i    was told this by a relative of my wife's who happens to be an fbi    agent.  his opinion of the batf was, ummm, well, let's just say    uncomplimentary.  4. i have *still* not been presented with one iota of evidence that    the bd's had *any* of the alleged illegal weaponry which was the    reason for the raid in the first place.  btw, we're *still* hearing    this justification.  ag reno, on cnn yesterday, made references    to this issue, without any substantiation.  she also waved around    the ""he's a child abuser and we heard he was beating the children!""    flag.  sigh.  5. a point re the feds in general: their handling of the whole siege    reflected a complete lack of understanding of the probable thought    processes of the cultists.  ag reno said they pushed the button    because they were afraid a mass suicide was in the offing.  my    only comment on that is that if the cultists were that close to    the edge, what the hell did she think their reaction would be to    an hours-long assault on the compound where holes were punched in    the walls and cs gas pumped in?  if i were a bd, i'd expect the    forces of the godless government to assault me at any time.  in    that light, whether they torched themselves or drank jim jones    kool-aid is irrelevant.  also, look at how the siege was conducted:    bright lights, loud rock music, cutting off communications and    other contact with the outside.  all measures designed to make the    bd's feel more and more isolated and threatened.  this might have    been a great strategy - if they were dealing with criminals.  as it    was, it looks to me like everything they did fed into koresh's    paranoid delusions.     --   #include <std_disclaimer.h>",16,talk.politics.guns

"from: center for policy research <cpr> subject: gaza and separation from israel   gaza and the idea of separation  the israeli left's inability to cope with the challenges it is presented with by reality becomes obvious at those moments when the reality does not line up with the expectations of the left. we were able to see this clearly during the gulf war.  because of the palestinian's popular solidarity with iraq, yossi sarid - currently minister of the environment - made his infamous statement: ""you look for me !"", i.e., i'am not making any more efforts to speak with you. from yossi sarid's point of view, palestinian reality during the gulf war was not the lengthy curfew or the danger of hunger it brought with it, but whether or not the palestinians accepted what was acceptable to the party. similarly meretz, mk deddi tzuker, recently faced with criticism from residents of the west bank town of beit sahour over his government's and his party's lack of action for human rights and peace, responded by asking those present at the discussion whether they would rather have a likud government. from the leftists' perspective this is the best government because it is their government, regardless of what it does.  these members of the israeli left have already decided how the future of the occupied territories will look, and they want to dictate to the palestinians how to get there. an essential step towards this future is their participation in yitzhak rabin's government, and from their point of view the expulsions were a marginal byproduct of this ""government of peace"", which need not disturb the routine course of events. likewise the ""rabinic"" policies in gaza - the blowing up of houses with anti-tank rockets and the significant increases in the number of persons injured in the suppression of demonstrations - need not disturb it.  but the fact that reality is not as they would have it forces itself upon them when a mob in gaza falls upon a settler who has lost his way, when a settler is stabbed by his palestinian workers, or when a palestinian knifes people in the streets of tel aviv. then all hell breaks loose and the israeli left has nothing to propose except separation: let's cut ourselves off from the palestinians, let's build a fence so high that they won't be able to harm us - this is the cry of the israeli left. let us erect a fence between us and the reality whith is the occupation.  meron benvenisti writes about this in ha'aretz (4-3-93): ""...the liberal left. which does not differentiate between physical separation and 'the future of the territories', must come to understand that the regime of magnetic cards, exclusion of arab workers, closure, and curfew are instruments of enforcement designed for the suppression of a population in revolt, and that their ideological support for separation only provides 'humanitarian' arguments for the legitimization of the <status quo>.  enforced separation is carried out only to meet the need of the ruling community, but it is only the ruled population which bears its burden. [.....].  ""whoover thinks that 'out of gaza first' is a liberal, humanitarian idea had best contemplate the question of whether this position is also moral. it is very easy to shake off responsibility for this concentration of human suffering, and to thus also disregard responsibility for it's creation. it is very easy to erect a fence between jewish and arab neighborhoods in jerusalem, when this fence has a gate - the keys to which are at the disposal of one hand - which opens to allow the jews to pursue all their interests, but is barred to the arabs..."".",17,talk.politics.mideast

"this was posted by lyn bates to the firearms-politics mailing list:  i recently learned that don kates was going to be in boston to give a talk at the harbard law school about the waco situation.  (of course, this was all set up after the incident started but long before its unhappy conclusion.)  so, yesterday i went to hear him.  what follows is a rough summary of what i think i heard him say, which should not be taken as exactly what he actually said...  kates started by saying that since he didn't know any more about the fire than the audience did (it had just happened the day before), he would not discuss that, but would concentrate on the original raid.  koresh definitely was not playing with a full deck.  but so what?  this isn't the first time that the leader of a new, small religious group has been ridiculed by the public.  extreme religious views nearly always fuel hatred and mistrust.  the first amendment applies, maybe especially, to people like koresh.  lengthy digression into the history of police organizations in the us. there were none until about 1830, when they began in metropolitan areas. police originally were not armed; if they found a crime in progress, they called local armed citizens to help.  many began to carry arms for protection despite regulations against them, eventually the laws were changed to allow them to carry guns.  the original intent was to have many small police departments, jealous of one another and competitive, but not large enough to be a threat to liberty, hence the plethora of organizations ranging from postal inspectors to the coast guard.  when the fbi was started, agents did not have the authority oto carry guns (they were to be, after all, a bureau of investigation, not a police force). ""all police agencies will be misused by anyone in power to maintain that power.""  the batf started as a tax collection agency, whose primary job was to raid illegal stills.  when the price of sugar went up so high that moonshiners no longer found their trade no longer profitable, many illegal stills disappeared, and the batf needed something else to do to justify its existence, so it turned to activities like phony raids on gun stores. around the time when the batf's annual budget is under review, the media is alerted by the batf to come to such-and-such a place, where at a pre-arranged time, a bunch of cars full of batf agents roar up to the door and the media get great pictures of the agents entering the premises of a gun dealer suspected of not keeping books properly.  the media isn't invited in for the boring hours of agents leafing through paperwork, but if any irregularities are found, the media gets to cover the agents removing armfuls of guns from the premises, and the luckless ffl in chains.  the waco incident happened a few weeks before batf's budget was up for review.  kates' opinion is that it was a staged publicity stunt that went bad, and that the batf never thought for a moment that they would actually be shot at, or they would have planned the raid differently (not sending 100 agents over open ground with no cover, for example), and would have had some medical personnel on hand.  he confirmed that some years ago there was a warrant for koresh's arrest in connection with a murder charge, and the local sheriff called him on the phone and explained about it.  koresh sais, ok, come pick me up, and the sheriff did, temporarily confiscating all the guns so that they could be tested.  koresh was later cleared, release, and presumably got his guns back.  at least at that time, he was rational enough to be approached rationally, and behaved in a reasonable manner.  the batf didn't take into account that, unlike most of the ffl's they audit, koresh was actually paranoid, and fostered paranoia in his followers.  thus the pubicity stunt looked like a real attack to them, and they reacted accordingly.  with respect to the original warrant, it had not been unsealed when kates was giving his talk, so he could not comment on it, except to mention that the batf has been known to not double-check the veractiy of their informants, if they can manage to get a judge to issue a warrant.  he had more to say about the way the warrant was served, which may have been completely illegal.  apparently the proper way to serve a warrant is to knock on the door and announce that you're an officer with a warrant for thus-and-so; if they don't open the door and the evidence is flushable, then it is ok to break in the door.  but since it is hard to flush guns down the toilet, there may have been no justification for the batf breaking in the way they did.  if the constitutional rights of the davidians were violated by an invalid warrant, or by an improperly served warrant, then the davidians may have been justified in their actons.  a close look at one of the original films shows that one batf agent _may_ have shot himself by accident when entering the building; if so, this was the first shot fired!  the role of the media could have been a whole lot worse.  after an initial position on the side of the batf, the media began to come around to the view that this might be a situation in which legally armed citizens held off a bad, possibly illegal attack.  a real cynic might say that the fbi went in when they did because it was clear that public opinion was beginning to change sides, and the fbi wanted to act before they lost the public's sympathy.  should the batf be abolished?  no.  police agencies _should_ be numerous, diverse, inefficient, decentralized, etc.  better a few inept accidents like this, than a move toward a single, large, well-organized, well-trained, powerful, domestic police force, which would eventually have even more tragic results.     - lyn bates      (bates@bbn.com)  ps don kates will be giving a shorter version of this talk at boston college law school next tuesday, april 27.  i don't know the exact time or place, but presumably a phone call to the bc law school could elicit that information.",16,talk.politics.guns

"i'm not quite sure how these numbers are generated.  it appears that in a neutral park bo's hr and slugging tend to drop (he actually loses two home runs).  or do they?  what is ""equivalent average?""  one thing, when looking at bo's stats, is that you can see that kc took away some homers.  normally, you expect some would-be homers to go for doubles or triples in big parks, or to be caught, and for that matter you expect lots of doubles and triples anyway.  but bo, despite his speed,  hit very few doubles and not that many triples.  so i would expect his value to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park.     felix jose has been a .350/.440 player in a fairly neutral park. i would offhand guess the `89-`90 bo at around a .330/.530 player. maybe .330/.550 .  not even close.   i'd put him about there too.    note: i hadn't realized the media had hyped him so much.  i thought he was always viewed by them as a better football player, and only so-so  at baseball.  he did only have one 30-hr, 100-rbi season, and kc wasn't winning.  note 2: i maybe have harped on this a bit in the past, but there is a mistake being made (by the sdcn's, as they are known, on this group) with respect to players like bo and deion and lofton (and perhaps others).  we find, that if you look at a large group of players, their past major and minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well. their are some caveats: the younger they are, the less good the prediction; the lower the minor league, the less good (i imagine), the more recent the player has left college ball, etc.  now of course, this prediction involves quite a bit of ""error.""  sometimes a player with poor mle's (dave justice, the 1990 ventura) becomes a star. some hitters develop (shane mack, brian downing), some don't (oddibe mcdowell, mickey brantley).  this error involves real things: there are real reasons why oddibe didn't hit and shane did.  it may (who knows) involve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting and so on.  but still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well. one of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background of the players.  one thing we know about professional baseball players is that all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playing ball.  their backgrounds are similar.  what hasn't been established is what happens when you encounter a player with a different background?  is there some reason to believe that a bo, or a deion, or a lofton, or a tony gwynn (?), or an ainge, or so on, has such a different background, that the standard model and standard assumptions fit this person slowly?  it hasn't been established that you can use mle's with two-sport players. (it hasn't been established that you can't, but then statistics is, after all, an art).  i personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually make completely nonsensical statements about bo and deion and lofton. ""look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers,"" they say.  well, what happens if those numbers simply don't mean what they usually mean? it might mean that ken lofton suddenly has a better year in houston than tuscon.  it might mean that deion suddenly has a better half-year in atlanta than greenville.    then again, it might not.  ken and deion might go right back in the tank this year, live up to those poor mle's.  but you guys don't know.  what's  worse, you don't know that you don't.  and you don't know that there are  other players you won't know about -- injuries and lifting and wheaties  again.  you seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal.  it's not. it's got some error.  oh well.  bill guilford",9,rec.sport.baseball

"take a look at the standings. it's real easy to get so focussed on  minutinae and forget that the giants happen to be in first place. if it's working, you don't screw it up by changing things, just because you think it ought to be different.  some folks like to argue about theoretical details. i prefer to watch teams win. when the giants slip to third, then we can talk about how to re-arrange the batting order. until then, i think it's stupid to focus on what's wrong, for the simple fact that it's working as it is.   in the majors? i don't follow al, so i won't comment on ""majors"". in the nl, if i had my choice of any 1b in the league for my team, it'd be clark, and i'd hit him third. (my fantasy team has both grace and murray on it, because i've never been able to get clark. i'd take any of the three without hesitation in real life, but i think clark is it).  williams: not even close. i much prefer his defense, but when he isn't headcasing it, matt has a good, solid swing and some real punch. if he drops to .230, then he wanders out of cleanup, but according to the latest baseball weekly, he's hitting .275, and in the last week, hitting .296. that's not exactly chopped liver.  mostly, though, the giants are winning, and frankly, as long as that continues, it's rather silly to second-guess their strategy. but evidently, some folks would rather be right than be first.",9,rec.sport.baseball

"archive-name: cryptography-faq/part02 last-modified: 1993/4/15   faq for sci.crypt, part 2: net etiquette  this is the second of ten parts of the sci.crypt faq. the parts are mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest. we don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask. notes such as ``[kah67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.  the sections of this faq are available via anonymous ftp to rtfm.mit.edu  as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  the cryptography  faq is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers  every 21 days.   contents:  * what groups are around? what's a faq? who am i? why am i here? * do political discussions belong in sci.crypt? * how do i present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt?   * what groups are around? what's a faq? who am i? why am i here?    read news.announce.newusers and news.answers for a few weeks. always   make sure to read a newsgroup for some time before you post to it.   you'll be amazed how often the same question can be asked in the same   newsgroup. after a month you'll have a much better sense of what the   readers want to see.  * do political discussions belong in sci.crypt?    no. in fact some newsgroups (notably misc.legal.computing) were   created exactly so that political questions like ``should rsa be   patented?'' don't get in the way of technical discussions. many   sci.crypt readers also read misc.legal.computing, comp.org.eff.talk,   comp.patents, sci.math, comp.compression, et al.; for the benefit of   people who don't care about those other topics, try to put your   postings in the right group.    questions about microfilm and smuggling and other non-cryptographic   ``spy stuff'' don't belong in sci.crypt either.  * how do i present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt?    ``i just came up with this neat method of encryption. here's some   ciphertext: fhdsijoyw^&%$*#@ogbujhkfsyuire. is it strong?'' without a   doubt questions like this are the most annoying traffic on sci.crypt.    if you have come up with an encryption scheme, providing some   ciphertext from it is not adequate. nobody has ever been impressed by   random gibberish. any new algorithm should be secure even if the   opponent knows the full algorithm (including how any message key is   distributed) and only the private key is kept secret. there are some   systematic and unsystematic ways to take reasonably long ciphertexts   and decrypt them even without prior knowledge of the algorithm, but   this is a time-consuming and possibly fruitless exercise which most   sci.crypt readers won't bother with.    so what do you do if you have a new encryption scheme? first of all,   find out if it's really new. look through this faq for references and   related methods. familiarize yourself with the literature and the   introductory textbooks.    when you can appreciate how your cryptosystem fits into the world at   large, try to break it yourself! you shouldn't waste the time of tens   of thousands of readers asking a question which you could have easily   answered on your own.    if you really think your system is secure, and you want to get some   reassurance from experts, you might try posting full details of your   system, including working code and a solid theoretical explanation, to   sci.crypt. (keep in mind that the export of cryptography is regulated   in some areas.)    if you're lucky an expert might take some interest in what you posted.   you can encourage this by offering cash rewards---for instance, noted   cryptographer ralph merkle is offering $1000 to anyone who can break   snefru-4---but there are no guarantees. if you don't have enough   experience, then most likely any experts who look at your system will   be able to find a flaw. if this happens, it's your responsibility to   consider the flaw and learn from it, rather than just add one more   layer of complication and come back for another round.    a different way to get your cryptosystem reviewed is to have the nsa   look at it. a full discussion of this procedure is outside the scope   of this faq.",11,sci.crypt

[pts] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- [pts]  [pts]  [pts]       the conflict over nagorno-karabakh: an azeri perspective [pts]       -------------------------------------------------------- [pts]                            by alec rasizade [pts]  [pts]   [ar] western readers have learned of the nagorno (upper) karabakh [ar] controversy through reports from that remote area by western [ar] correspondents and from commentaries by member of the long-established [ar] armenian-american community.  azeri views on this dispute have [ar] appeared rarely if at all in the western news media.  therefore let me [ar] present _washington report_ readers with some basic truths about the [ar] origins of the conflict.  during the past two years, if one reads all the commentaries on the subject, a small minority of the writers have been armenia or azeri.  the following should be interesting.   [ar] armenian leaders claim that azerbaijan was the first to oppress and [ar] expel the armenian minority from the azerbaijani republic.  actually, [ar] the initiative to banish the azeri minority and convert the armenian [ar] republic into a homogeneous state began in the winter of 1987-1988, [ar] when 165,000 azeris were driven out of armenia.  following that move, [ar] there were massacres of armenians in the azerbaijani cities of sumgait [ar]in february 1988 and two years later, in baku in january 1990.  this not true. other than simply checking the newspapers, i will quote from an independent human rights report. in the _pax cristi netherlands_, 29 september 1991, page 28, we read:   ""by mid-november, many incidents took place in several places in   azerbaijan. the apf [azeri popular front] challenged the communist party   for power. ... after ten days, the authorities came in with tanks to   reimpose their power. in nakhitchevan, the last armenian villages were   deported. in ganja, armenians were attacked and killed. all 40,000    armenian inhabitants fled the city...""    between 22 november and 8 december 1988, refugees from ganja arrived in   armenia while all 167,000 azeris in armenia were chased away.""  in this part of the world february 1988 [start of organized anti-armenian  pogroms in azerbaijan] come before november and december of 1988!  [ar] azeri parliamentary committees have compiled evidence indicating that [ar] both events were inspired from moscow to secure russian imperial rule [ar] in the transcaucasus, according to the roman principle of ""divide and [ar] rule.""  similar conspiracies are evident throughout the five-year [ar] history of the conflict.  it is interesting that the azeris killed, burnt, raped the armenians but the perpetrators blame russians, and armenians themselves on other occasions.   [ar] each time the parties have been about to reach an agreement (in [ar] zheleznovodsk, moscow, tehran, rome, geneva and alma-ata), an [ar] invisible hand provoked further bloodshed.  those interested in [ar] maintaining the azeri-armenian conflict, as well as the georgian [ar] turmoil, are imperialist forces in russia, and probably in iran.  incorrect! when were the people of nagorno-karabakh ever involved in an agreement? never. until azerbaijan sits down with the armenians of nagorno- karabakh there will never be an end to this conflict.   [ar] the armenian offensive last spring created more than 100,000 new azeri [ar] refugees from the captured towns of upper and lower karabakh and [ar] adjacent rural districts.  today 500,000 azeri refugees throng the [ar] city of baku and environs, providing more problems for the newly [ar] elected popular front government, which is opposed by the rigidly [ar] nationalistic national independence party.   it's called war. if the azerbaijanis didn't try to deport and allow the  armenians of nagorno-karabakh to live in their ways, keep their armenian culture, these armenians would not have had to defend their existence. the azeris should not have assumed that armenians were going to roll over and play dead.   [ar] how can a western-style democracy survive in a small muslim country [ar] where 1 million of the 7 million inhabitants are unemployed?  in the [ar] absence of any international effort to help azeri refugees, as kurdish [ar] and bosnian refugees have been helped, how can the azeri government [ar] reject the demand of these exiles to recapture their lands, homes and [ar] possessions?  the azeri government should have thought about such thnings before they attempted to deprive armenians of ""lands, homes, and possessions"".   [ar] such simple realities must be understood in the west. [ar] misunderstanding caucasian politics leads both western and russian [ar] public opinion to imagine a permanent, and therefore irreversible, [ar] ethnic and religious rivalry in the caucasus.  true, and you, dr. alec rasizade, should practice what you preach!   [ar] i think western reluctance to interfere derives from this idea. [ar] meanwhile, continuation of the war could draw both eastern and western [ar] states into the conflict through activation of various security [ar] alliances.  these include, on the armenian side, the moscow-led [ar] commonwealth forces under the tashkent mutual security pact, signed [ar] may 15, 1992.  on the azeri side, should turkey get involved as the [ar] guarantor of the nakhichevan autonomy through the kars treaty of oct. [ar] 13, 1921, these include the north atlantic treaty forces.  western interference! turkish intervention! the moment turkey dares step into this conflict it will close the doors of any chance of turkey being part of  europe (as if it ever will) and will destroy the eastern third of anatolia! dr. rasizade, international realpolitik is not as simple-minded as you would have us believe.   [ar] upper karabakh generally is described in western press reports as an [ar]""armenian enclave within azerbaijan.""  the truth is that the armenians [ar] began to appear there only in the middle of the last century.  incorrect once again. a brief scan of history addresses such a foolish claim.   armenians today, refer to the area of nagorno-karabakh as ""artsakh"", which  comes from the urartian term ""urtekhe-urtekhini"". no azeris yet!   ancient greeks referred to artsakh as ""orkhistena"". no azeris yet!  in the first half of the 6th century b.c., artsakh, as part of ervandid armenia of media. no azeris yet!  from the end of the 4th century b.c., artsakh was part of the armenian kingdom of ervan. no azeris yet!  artsakh was still part of the armenian empire of tigran. orkhistena, or  artsakh is refereed to by strabo, as part of armenia. no azeris yet!  after armenia was divided between the persian and byzantine empires in 387  a.d. until 428, artsakh was part of armenia. no azeris yet!  end of the 5th century, utik and artsakh became principalities of the  aranshakhiks. no azeris yet!  by the 7th century an artsakh dialect of armenian formed. no azeris yet!  emperor konstantin (913-959) addressees a letter to the prince of khachen ""to armenia"". khachen was the central principality of artsakh. no azeris yet!  in the decree of paul i (1797), the number of armenian families in this area was stated as 11,000.  it was from the 16th to the 18th centuries that non-armenians from central asia, asia minor, and kurdistan first began to be exercise political influence in the planes of artsakh. caucasian muslims around karabakh!  in 1813 karabagh becomes part of russia. officiallt part of russia 1828. some  muslims in karabakh!  in 1914, the number of armenian churches in nagorno-karabagh was 224, 188 priests, 206,768 parishioners in 224 armenian towns and villages. the armenian percentage of the population was over 90%. max: 10% azeris in karabakh -- assuming no kurds!  consider the following statement by the azerbaijani revcom on december 1, 1920:   ""the worker-peasant government of azerbaidzan, having been informed of the   proclamation of armenia a soviet socialist republic, sends its greetings   to the brother people. from this day the previous boundaries between   armenia and azerbaidzan are annulled. nagornyi karabakh, zangezur, and   nakhichevan are recognized as integral parts of the armenian socialis   republic.    long live the brotherhood and union of the workers and peasants of soviet   armenia and azerbaidzan!  				chairman of the revcom of azerbaidzan 							n. narimanov  				people's commissar for foreign affairs 							guseinov""  [ar] a few years ago they celebrated the 150th anniversary of their [ar] resettlement from persia to karabakh, after it came under russian [ar] rule.   no, incorrect. the 1988 celebration was the 150th anniversary of russian rule in the caucasus, including karabakh!  [ar] at the same time the russian colonial administration also drew [ar] in russian and german settlers, who were welcomed by azeris.  how [ar] would americans react if the large numbers of armenians living in [ar] southern california suddenly claimed an armenian homeland, and [ar] demanded separation from california?  non-sequitur.    [ar] armenian historians insist that before the armenian resettlement [ar] karabakh was inhabited by aboriginal christians.  that is correct.  armenian historians don't say this!  [ar] the people of medieval caucasian albania adopted christianity in the [ar] fourth century.  but those ancient residents had no link to and [ar] nothing in common with armenians.  considering the caucasian albans were of the armenian apostolic faith, and their utilization of the armenian language in their liturgy, makes such an  argument totally invalid!  [ar] azeris would have a better claim to [ar] be successors of albania, since azeris have for centuries inhabited, [ar] dominated, and developed the karabakh part of the azeri nation.  wishing to be part of a people non-existent for nearly a millennium for geo- political advantage is rather outrageous. in addition to such absurdity, azeris claim to be turks, persians, and all the while are azerizing their minorities, such as the lezgians, kurds, tat, talish, and a host of other nationalities which may amount to nearly half the population of azerbaijan.  [ar] both armenia and azerbaijan last year signed the final act of the [ar] conference on security and cooperation in europe of 1975, and the [ar] paris charter for new europe of 1990, confirming their mutual [ar] adherence to the principle of inviolability of existing borders.  this [ar] principle means that the borders and territorial integrity of the [ar] republic of azerbaijan are to be guaranteed by all of the signatory [ar] nations, not just by turkey.  such agreements do not give azerbaijan the right to de-populate karabakh of armenians.   [ar] this is one key to intervention on behalf either of the u.n., the [ar] csce, the commonwealth, nato or iran.  the second key to untying the [ar] caucasian knot is to determine who is the aggressor, according to the [ar] u.n. definition of 1974.  fine, so why has azerbaijan refused to allow un troops into the armenian enclave? what is azerbaijan afraid of? perhaps the fact that the territory is the home of armenians, the un, would by definition, support the local population!    [ar] when that is accomplished, the international community can and should [ar] apply to the aggressor in the caucasus international sanctions such as [ar] those presently being employed against serbia and montenegro in the [ar] former yugoslavia.  such decisive collective international action can [ar] halt further aggression in karabakh, and prevent the armenian-azeri [ar] conflict from growing and spreading.   azerbaijan's refusal to allow the armenians of karabakh to determine their own future the is issue, not viewing isolating events out of context are  actions that will address the karabakh conflict. viewing events in a war in isolation and out of context is like viewing the landing at normandy as an act of allied aggression!    [ar] dr. alec rasizade, senior research officer at the academy of sciences [ar] of azerbaijan, is a visiting researcher at the harriman institute of [ar] columbia university in new york.  ha!",17,talk.politics.mideast

"let me improve this one for you, then. for nearly one thousand years,  the turkish and kurdish people lived on their homeland - the last  one hundred under the oppressive soviet and armenian occupation. the  persecutions culminated in 1914: the armenian government planned and  carried out a genocide against its muslim subjects. 2.5 million turks  and kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their homeland.  after one thousand years, turkish and kurdish lands were empty of turks and kurds.   the survivors found a safe heaven in turkiye.  today, x-soviet armenian government rejects the right of turks and  kurds to return to their muslim lands occupied by x-soviet armenia.  today, x-soviet armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its  predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against  humanity.  x-soviet armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the muslims  by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the turks and kurds.  turks and kurds demand the right to return to their lands, to determine their own future as a nation in their own homeland.  ...on this occasion, we once again reiterate the unquestioned  justice of the restitution of turkish and kurdish rights and...  - we demand that the x-soviet armenian government admit its  responsibility for the turkish and kurdish genocide, render  reparations to the muslim people, and return the land to its  rightful owners. the recognition of the genocide has become an  issue which cannot be delayed further, and it is imperative that  artificial obstacles created for political manipulations be removed.  - we believe the time has come to demand from the the united states  that it formally recognizes the turkish and kurdish genocide, adopts  the principles of our demands and refuses to accede to armenian pressures  to the contrary.  - as taxpayers of the united states, we express our vehement  protest to the present u.s. government policy of continued  coddling, protection and unqualified assistance towards x-soviet armenia.  - our territorial demands are strictly aimed at x-soviet armenia's.   source: ""from sardarapat to sevres and lausanne"" by avetis aharonian. the  armenian review, vol. 16, no. 3-63, autumn, sep. 1963, pp. 47-57.  p. 52 (second paragraph).

"% %by elias davidsson - april 1991 (revision oct. 1991)  note - you are already posting ""facts"", some of which are outdated.  the biased presentation of facts, as well as the conclusions that you reach leave me little hope of engaging in any fruitful exchange that might lead to a ""meeting of the minds"".  it is to those who read with open mind, that i address myself.  %the international convention on the elimination of all forms of %racial discrimination adopted by the general assembly of the %united nations in 1965, has now been ratified by most member %states. article 1 of this convention defines the term racial %discrimination as ""any distinction, exclusion, restriction or %preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic %origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing %the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of %human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, %social, cultural or any other field of public life.""  while the ideals embodied in this text are worthy goals, as the text currently stands i know of no country in which racial discrimination of some sort can not be found. it makes no mention of the need for for a legislative violation.  %the general assembly endorsed in 1975 a resolution defining %zionism as a form of racism and racial discrimination. the %important, correct and legitimate resolution is incomplete since %it does not include operative statements designed to end israeli %racial discrimination. meanwhile the united states, on behalf of %israel, are exerting heavy pressure on member states of the united %nations to repeal this resolution and give israeli racial %practices - zionism - moral legitimacy.  if you are, in principle, advocating un intervention via operative statements in this case, it must therefore hold that they can be applied to any other case where the council perceives some form of racial discrimination as previously exhibited.  scarey thought.  %the very definition of israel as a state belonging to the jews of %the world (but not to its inhabitants), alienates all native %non-jews born in that country.   actually, i know quite a few native non-jews born in israel that are not alienated by this law.  if you had said some, you would probably be correct, however your tendency to exagerate and slant facts becomes apparent.  this slant permeates the text.  %practically all non-jews who are living in or originate from areas %under israeli control, identify themselves as palestinians. most %of them are muslim, many are christian. a few jews, including the %author of these lines, also identify themselves as palestinians.  the above statement is not true.  practically all - discounting beduins, circassians, druze, and some other fringe groups. your own identification is a matter that has no bearing upon the issue.  you could equally identify yourself as a [insert group].  %zionism took off in europe at the end of last century. it's aim %was to create a jewish state in palestine in spite of the adamant %opposition of palestinian arabs (95% of the population).  if i recall correctly, at the time ""zionism"" took off, there was no adamant opposition in palestine.  i am open to any factual contradictory evidence .  %but the %zionists were more powerful, militarily, economically and %technologically, and succeeded in 1948 in conquering 70% of the %area of mandatory palestine. after driving into exile most native %arabs from the conquered areas, approximately 750,000 people, and %razing most of their villages to the ground, the zionists could %finally establish a predominantly jewish state. only 150,000 %non-jews remained on israeli territory.  do you therefore contend that the 400 villages you mention further on ""most of their villages""?  %once the jewish state was established, it began enacting laws to %help the confiscation of land from native non-jews, their %political repression and their destitution.  there is no doubt that laws passed provided a framework which was later used for these purposes.  however, you seem to imply that this was the intention a priori, which implies a policy and agenda.  my knowledge was that this was not the case.  you also neglect to mention the circumstances that surrounded this.  as you do again, below.  %in 1967 the state of israel invaded egypt and syria and occupied %the rest of palestine (the west bank and the gaza strip). thus %another 1.5 million palestinians fell under its juridiction. its %occupation of palestinian and other arab territories is considered %illegal by the international community, as reflected in security %council resolutions. israel has rejected all u.n. resolutions and %began without delay to entrench its occupation and rule over these %territories with the aim of annexing them at the appropriate time.  not quite accurate.  israel has not rejected all the resolutions, though it has conflicting understanding with regards to some of them. israel never annexed the sinai, west bank, or gaza.  the other annexations were brought about partly due to the un resolutions.  %part of these territores, east jerusalem and the golan heights, %have already been forcefully annexed by israel, in defiance of %international law and un resolutions.  out of curiousity, provided that the annexees are granted citizenship, what int'l law do you claim prohibits annexation of territories captured in war?  has this ever been applied to any other country previously (other than iraq) ?  %it must be emphasized that, although these people live under %different regimes, they are united in their self-perception as %palestinians, that is as people identifying with palestine, a %territorial entity (not an ethnic or religious entity).  incorrect! palestinians themselves claim to be discriminated against on an ""ethnic or racial"" basis.  therefore your above statement is incorrect.  i also note that given the previous definition of racial discrimination, the only means that you could argue for that is nationalistically. however, no such nation has existed.  it definitely did not exist at the time of the creation of israel, in which case you can not argue racial discrimination during that period!  %furthermore palestinians generally consider the plo both as a %symbol of national identity and as the unchallenged authority that %represents them in world affairs.  once again, some do, some don't.  %the non-jewish population living in the palestinian and other arab %territories occupied by israel in 1967 suffers not only blatant %discrimination but is subject to brutal military occupation.  another generalization, but then again, you don't seem to care about anyone other than the palestinian people, whose cause you espouse.  %licence, to start a business and to buy industrial equipment, the %right to educate children, all of these basic rights are subject %to arbitrary rulings by military authorities and cannot be %challenged in court.  incorrect once again.  they have the ability to appeal. furthermore, although you may not agree with them, not all of the military rulings are senseless or arbitrary.  some are, but this is not due to the ""whims"" of the military as much as the sizeof the task/organization.  %only jewish inhabitants of the occupied %territories are permitted to carry firearms.  incorrect once again.  i know two arab policemen who lived in daheisha and there were more.  of course, with the outbreak of the intifada they were forced by the locals to resign, bitterly.  %jewish settlers have %right to 6-7 more water per person than non-jews. jewish residents %of these territories number now about 100,000 people. it is israel %governmentus policy to increase this number substantially, in %total defiance of international law, un resolutions and the will %of the population. the state of israel systematically confiscates %land from non-jewish inhabitants of these territories for jewish %settlement.  that is no longer true, and i can't help but wonder what your purpose is/was in posting this.  %some 800,000 people in israel proper,are not jews. most of them %consider themselves palestinians with israeli citizenship. for %many years after the establishment of israel they were subjected %to harsh military control. much of their land was confiscated by %the state and handed to jewish organisations for exclusive jewish %settlement. they have been subject to massacres, destitution and %humiliation. while they enjoy, with jewish israelis, the right to %vote, they are discriminated against both through law and in %practice.  once again, to hell with the other minorities that don't fit in, right?  their are many villages who did not suffer in the way you seem to indicate, abu gosh comes to mind.  yes, some did but as a result of what actions?  %approximately 92% of the surface of the state of israel within the %rgreen lines is for all purposes closed to palestinians who are %second-class citizens in israel. they may neither legally live on %such land, nor rent or cultivate it. a direct effect of these %policies is that native non-jewish citizens of israel are denied %residence and membership rights in most rural communities in %israel, including the collective settlements, kibbutzim. non-jews %are discriminated against in many other ways: the government %starves local authorities of palestinian villages and townships of %funds; jewish city councils force palestinians to live in ghettos; %jewish families receive higher child allocations than their %non-jewish neighbors, palestinian schools suffer underfunding and %understaffing (as compared to jewish schools); palestinian %children are denied the right to learn their history and %literature; israelis who struggle for equal rights and for the end %of racial discrimination, suffer continuous harassment by the %authorities.  1.  there are some kibbutzim with arab/non-jewish members.     it is up to the members of the kibbutz.  there is no     legislation against it, nor against a purely non-jewish     collective.  2.  funds are the result of political lobbying.  bearing in mind     that non_jews compose ~20% of the voting population, it has     never failed to amaze me that they fail to form one large     bloc, and increase their power.  the recent elections are a case      in point.  3.  please provide factual evidence supporting your allegation     with regard to educational material.  you have obviously     never seen the curriculum of a school in the west bank.     it is based upon jordan's school system.  4.  with regard to your last statement, it is simply another     gross generalization.    %the state of israel refuses to acknowledge itself as the state of %all its inhabitants.  although the israeli cabinet has never %openly endorsed the 'transfer' idea (the forced removal from the %country of its native palestinian population, that is, its %ultimate judaization), israeli government policies towards %non-jews bear the mark of this 'final solution'. no attempt is %made by the zionist authorities to integrate palestinian arabs %into israeli public life. thus, although comprising approximately %17% of the population of israeli citizens, no palestinian citizen %of israel has ever served as cabinet member, as director of  %ministry or of a national institution, as judge of the supreme %court, as ambassador of israel, or in any leading position in %israeli economic or financial life. even the director of the %ministry for arab affairs - yes, such a thing exists! - is a jew.  another generalization, but lets not stop here. the transfer idea was espoused by one party in the last gov't, moledet.  it was intended to be a solution to the problem in the territories, not the country itself.  with regard to other items, i recall at least one arab ambassador, and the rest was covered previously.  %although sexual %relations between and cohabitation of jews and non-jews are legal, %they are considered by israeli/zionist society somewhat a betrayal %of the jewish and zionist ethics. the israeli educational system %nurtures this attitude in a systematic way.  when was the last time you were in israel?  that is simply not true, nor has it been for quite some time.  the question of religious intervention is best answered by the proportional representation and the lack of any arab party bloc to counter the orthodox one.  %zionism rejects the idea of a modern secular state, based on %equality of all citizens. this is one main reason why israel has %not produced any written constitution.   simply incorrect. the answer is political.  once again, your failure to understand the dynamics and movements inside israeli gov't, relegates your contentions to the sidelines.  %zionism predicates a state %where jews have privileged rights. thus, according to israeli law, %a jew born in london, who has never visited israel, does not speak %hebrew and professes atheism, is granted automatic israeli %citizenship, while native palestinian inhabitants who happen to be %christian or muslim, are treated almost as aliens.  racial %discrimination, as defined in international law, is thus not only %reflected in israeli laws and policies, but is grounded in the %very nature of israel as a jewish state.  but the discrimination is not based upon race. oops, sorry, nasty habit i have of countering malicious false truths.  %any proposal for israeli-arab and israeli-palestinian peace that %does not address the issue of racial discrimination by israel - %that is the zionist nature of the state of israel - is thus doomed %to fail.  real world intrusion - any proposal that does is doomed to fail. of course, i wouldn't expect you to understand, wrapped up as you are in your view of things.  let's not let anything penetrate shall we!?!  i may be a bit too sarcastic but there is a limit to the amount of patience i have for rubbish at 02:00.",17,talk.politics.mideast

"archive-name: space/new_probes last-modified: $date: 93/04/01 14:39:17 $  upcoming planetary probes - missions and schedules      information on upcoming or currently active missions not mentioned below     would be welcome. sources: nasa fact sheets, cassini mission design     team, isas/nasda launch schedules, press kits.       asuka (astro-d) - isas (japan) x-ray astronomy satellite, launched into     earth orbit on 2/20/93. equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20     angstrom) x-ray telescope, x-ray ccd cameras, and imaging gas     scintillation proportional counters.       cassini - saturn orbiter and titan atmosphere probe. cassini is a joint     nasa/esa project designed to accomplish an exploration of the saturnian     system with its cassini saturn orbiter and huygens titan probe. cassini     is scheduled for launch aboard a titan iv/centaur in october of 1997.     after gravity assists of venus, earth and jupiter in a vvejga     trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at saturn in june of 2004. upon     arrival, the cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an     orbit around saturn. near the end of this initial orbit, the huygens     probe separates from the orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of     titan. the orbiter relays the probe data to earth for about 3 hours     while the probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the     surface. after the completion of the probe mission, the orbiter     continues touring the saturnian system for three and a half years. titan     synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of titan and     targeted flybys of iapetus, dione and enceladus. the objectives of the     mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of saturn's atmosphere,     rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of saturn's     satellites, and characterize titan's atmosphere and surface.      one of the most intriguing aspects of titan is the possibility that its     surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that     result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. these     hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain     down onto the surface. the cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to     peer through titan's clouds and determine if there is liquid on the     surface. experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will     investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.      the cassini mission is named for jean dominique cassini (1625-1712), the     first director of the paris observatory, who discovered several of     saturn's satellites and the major division in its rings. the titan     atmospheric entry probe is named for the dutch physicist christiaan     huygens (1629-1695), who discovered titan and first described the true     nature of saturn's rings.  	 key scheduled dates for the cassini mission (vvejga trajectory)

  ulysses- european space agency probe to study the sun from an orbit over     its poles. launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields     experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for     various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.      since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send ulysses far out of     the ecliptic plane, it went to jupiter instead, and stole energy from     that planet by sliding over jupiter's north pole in a gravity-assist     manuver in february 1992. this bent its path into a solar orbit tilted     about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. it will pass over the sun's south pole     in the summer of 1993. its aphelion is 5.2 au, and, surprisingly, its     perihelion is about 1.5 au-- that's right, a solar-studies spacecraft     that's always further from the sun than the earth is!      while in jupiter's neigborhood, ulysses studied the magnetic and     radiation environment. for a short summary

15 years and study the mysteries and fate of the universe.  	o earth observing system (eos) 	    possible launch in 1997, 1 of 6 us orbiting space platforms to 	    provide long-term data (15 years) of earth systems science 	    including planetary evolution.  	o mercury observer 	    possible 1997 launch.  	o lunar observer 	    possible 1997 launch, would be sent into a long-term lunar 	    orbit. the observer, from 60 miles above the moon's poles, would 	    survey characteristics to provide a global context for the 	    results from the apollo program.  	o space infrared telescope facility 	    possible launch by shuttle in 1999, this is the 4th element of 	    the great observatories program. a free-flying observatory with 	    a lifetime of 5 to 10 years, it would observe new comets and 	    other primitive bodies in the outer solar system, study cosmic 	    birth formation of galaxies, stars and planets and distant 	    infrared-emitting galaxies  	o mars rover sample return (mrsr) 	    robotics rover would return samples of mars' atmosphere and 	    surface to earch for analysis. possible launch dates: 1996 for 	    imaging orbiter, 2001 for rover.  	o fire and ice 	    possible launch in 2001, will use a gravity assist flyby of 	    earth in 2003, and use a final gravity assist from jupiter in 	    2005, where the probe will split into its fire and ice 	    components: the fire probe will journey into the sun, taking 	    measurements of our star's upper atmosphere until it is 	    vaporized by the intense heat. the ice probe will head out 	    towards pluto, reaching the tiny world for study by 2016.",14,sci.space

"always existing and being the source of the existence of all other beings is not problematic.  but, as you put, being the source of ""all"" existence, including one's own, would mean that god came from nothing, a concept alien to christianity and theism.  it is better to understand the classical concepts of necessary and contingent existence.  god exists necessarily, always.  god created contingent beings.  this is a coherent solution to existence, so long as the concept of god is coherent.    not a very good answer.  if reason cannot by any means understand something then it is likely that ""it"" is a null concept, something not in reality.",15,soc.religion.christian

"-*---- i think that part of the problem is that i have proposed a definition of science that i intended to be interpreted broadly and that lee lady has interpreted fairly narrowly.  my definition is this: science is the investigation of the empirical that avoids mistakes in reasoning and methodology discovered from previous   unless one classifies ""thinking and informal exploration"" as a mistake, they fall under my definition.  i hope no one would consider speculation, thinking, and informal exploration as unscientific.     here is where i think we are talking at cross-purposes.  it is not clear to me that the kind of definition i have proposed should be taken as describing what ""science is mainly about.""  consider, for example, a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking a backbone.  this fairly tells what is an invertebrate and what is not an invertebrate, but it hardly tells you what invertebrates are all about.  one can read this definition and still not know that 95% of all animal species are invertebrates, that invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form, that some invertebrate groups -- such as insects and nematodes -- are ubiquitous in all ecosystems, etc.  in short, knowing the definition of invertebrates does *not* tell one what they are ""mainly about.""  the misunderstanding here is my fault.  i did not give sufficient context for people to understand my proposed definition.   i agree on both counts.  as an example of the second, it would only take a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians that a treatment was effective, despite a lack of controls.    as to the first, i do not think it is useful to talk about ""absolute scientific truth.""  i think it is more useful to talk about the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the kinds of evidence in particular fields that in the past have proven faulty or reliable.  the latter is obviously a matter of degree, and in each field, practitioners try to discover the relevance of different kinds of evidence.    one of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as psuedo-science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion regarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim, the kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it, and the historical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence are given more weight than others.  it is perfectly alright to speculate.  i have read quite a few refereed papers that speculated left and right.  but the authors were careful to identify the notions as speculative, to list what little evidence was presently available for them, and to describe how research could proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to uncover its problems.  often what distinguishes whether a paper of this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the author sets the context and paves the way for future work.  (it is in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail.)   i think a lot of scientists steer away from things that -- deserving or not -- garner a patina of kookiness.  when proponents of some practice see no value in more careful investigation of that practice, that sets alarms ringing in many researchers' minds.    this is unfortunate, because there is undoubtedly some intersection between things that are worth investigating and things that are advocated by those who seem careless or unreasonable in their advocacy.  on the other hand, i can understand why many scientists would just as soon select other directions for research.  as gordon banks has pointed out, no one wants to become this generation's rhine.   i think this is absurd.     i wonder why the results were not published.  in my field, dissertation results are typically summarized in papers that are submitted to journals.  often the papers are accepted for publication before the dissertation is finished.  (this certainly eases one's defense.)  finally, i hope lee lady will forgive me from commenting either on nlp or the discussion of it in sci.psychology.  i know little about either and so have nothing to offer.",13,sci.med

"no wonder you 'wieneramus' are in such a mess. following the greek  cypriot attempt to annex the island to greece with the aid of the greek  army, turkiye intervened by using her legal right given by two international  agreements. turkiye did it for the frequently and conveniently forgotten  people of the island, turkish cypriots. for those turkish cypriots whose  grandparents have been living on the island since 1571. and the next is 'karabag'.  the people of turkiye know quite well that greece and the greek  cypriots will never abandon the idea of hellenizing cyprus and will  remain eternally hopeful of uniting it with greece, someday, whatever  the cost to the parties involved. the history speaks for itself. greece  was the sole perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on july 15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of archibishop makarios.  the release of nikos sampson, a member of eoka [national organization of cypriot fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the 'enosis' mentality continues to survive in greece. one should not forget that sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the turks in cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried to destroy the island's independence by annexing it to greece. of course, the greek governments will have to bear the consequences  for this irresponsible conduct.               the museum of barbarism  2 irfan bey street, kumsal area, nicosia, cyprus  it is the  house of dr. nihat  ilhan, a major who  was serving at the cyprus  turkish army contingent. during  the attacks launched against the turks by the greeks, on 20th december 1963, dr. nihat ilhan's  wife and  three  children were  ruthlessly and  brutally killed in the  bathroom, where they had tried to  hide, by savage greeks. dr.  nihat ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night, the 24th   december  1963.   pictures  reflecting   greek  atrocities committed during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house which has been converted into a museum.  an eye-witness account  of how a turkish family  was butchered by greek terrorists  the date  is the 24th of  december, 1963... the onslaught  of the greeks against the turks, which  started three days ago, has been going on  with all its  ferocity; and defenseless women,  old men and children are being brutally  killed by greeks. and now kumsal area of nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the greeks savage bloodshed...  the wife  and the  three infant  children of  dr. nihat  ilhan, a major on duty at the camp  of the cyprus turkish army contingent, are  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  the bathroom of their house, by  maddened greeks who broke into their home. a glaring example of greek barbarism.  let us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by mr. hasan  yusuf gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was wounded during the same terrible event.  ""on the night of the 24th  of december, 1963 my wife feride hasan and i were paying a visit to the family of major dr. nihat ilhan. our neighbours  mrs. ayshe of  mora, her daughter ishin  and mrs. ayshe's  sister novber  were also  with us.  we were  all sitting having supper.  all of  a sudden bullets  from the  pedieos river direction started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain. thinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was dangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought would be  safer. altogether we were  nine persons. we all  hid in the bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. we waited in fear. mrs. ilhan the wife of major doctor, was standing in the bath with her three children murat, kutsi and hakan in her arms. suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open. greeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the house with  their machine  gun bullets.  during these  moments i  heard voices saying, in  greek, ""you want taksim eh!""  and then bullets started flying in the bathroom. mrs. ilhan and her three children fell into  the bath. they were  shot. at this moment  the greeks, who broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. i heard one of the major's children moan, then i fainted.  when i came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, i saw  mrs. ilhan and her three children lying dead in the  bath. i and the rest of the neighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. but what had happened to my wife? then i remembered and immediately ran to the  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  i saw  her  body. she  was brutally murdered.  in the  street admist the  sound of  shots i heard  voices crying ""help, help. is  there no one to save us?""  i became terrified. i thought that  if the greeks came  again and found that  i was not dead they would kill  me. so i ran to the  bedroom and hid myself under the double-bed.  an our  passed by. in the  distance i could still  hear shots. my mouth was dry,  so i came out  from under the bed  and drank some water. then i put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the bathroom, which was exactly as i had left in an hour ago. there i offered sweets  to mrs. ayshe,  her daughter and mrs.  novber who were all wounded.  we  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o'clock in  the morning.  i thought morning would never come.  we were all wounded and needed to be taken  to hospital. finally, as we could  walk, mrs. novber and i, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walked as far as koshklu chiftlik.  there, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were operated on. when  i regained my consciousness i  said that there were more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought mrs. ayshe and her daughter.  after staying three  days in the hospital i was  sent by plane to ankara  for  further treatment.  there  i  have had  four  months treatment but still i cannot use  my arm. on my return to cyprus, greeks arrested me at the airport.  all  i have  related to  you above  i told  the greeks  during my detention. they then released me.""  on foot into cyprus's devastated turkish quarter  we went tonight into the sealed-off turkish quarter of nicosia in which 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last five days.  we  were the  first  western  reporters there,  and  we saw  some terrible sights.  in the kumsal quarter at no. 2, irfan bey sokagi, we made our way into  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  a child's bicycle lay in a corner.  in the  bathroom, looking  like a group  of waxworks,  were three children piled on top of their murdered mother.  in a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in the head.  this, we  were told, was the  home of a turkish  army major whose family had been killed by the mob in the first violence.  today was five days later, and still they lay there.  rene maccoll and daniel mcgeachie, (from the ""daily express"")  ""...i saw in  a bathroom the bodies of a  mother and three infant children murdered because their father was a turkish officer...""  max clos, le figaro 25-26 january, 1964  serdar argic",17,talk.politics.mideast
"* attention voters: * * i had a problem with my mailbox on the first day of voting. * please check the vote acknowlegement (ack) at the end of this cfv. * if your name/address is not there, please send your vote again. * (actually, check even if you voted after the first day)   introduction:  	this is the third (and final) call for votes (cfv) for the creation 	of four os/2 newsgroups and the renaming of one: 	(a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting     (unmoderated) 	(b)  renaming of comp.os.os2.programmer to 	     comp.os.os2.programmer.misc               (unmoderated) 	(c)  comp.os.os2.setup                         (unmoderated) 	(d)  comp.os.os2.multimedia                    (unmoderated) 	(e)  comp.os.os2.bugs                          (unmoderated)  	this is the second attempt at creating comp.os.os2.programmer.porting 	and comp.os.os2.setup, and renaming comp.os.os2.programmer to 	comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.  the first attempt failed in the summer 	of 1992 (the voting deadline was august 31, 1992).  the voting rules 	state that another attempt for creating newsgroups can be started 	after a six month waiting period (in this case, it is march 1, 1993). 	this is the first attempt at creating comp.os.os2.multimedia and 	comp.os.os2.bugs.  	this document contains: 	*  the background showing the need for these proposals 	*  the proposed charters for these proposals 	*  voting instructions 	*  a voting ballot 	*  some example ballots 	*  the voting rules 	*  the voting schedule 	*  the mass acknowledgement   background:  	the creation of two, free, 32-bit compilers for os/2 2.x (gcc/2 	and emx/gcc; read comp.os.os2.programmer for details) has spurred 	a continuing deluge of software ported from unix platforms, such 	as emacs, less, awk, grep, sed, xscheme, ispell, flex, yacc, and 	much more.  borland has released its c/c++ compiler for os/2 2.x, 	allowing for easier porting of dos and windows software.  	much of the pc hardware and drivers were written for dos, and 	later, windows.  as more people are discovering os/2 2.x, the 	number of people asking questions about os/2's compatibility 	with their hardware increases, as does the questions on the 	availability of drivers for their hardware, installation 	procedures, etc.  	multimedia is becoming popular.  os/2 2.0 supports windows 	multimedia extensions using win-os/2 3.0.  furthermore, ibm is 	including direct multimedia support in os/2 starting with version 	2.1 (in addition to using win-os/2 3.1).  	any non-trivial software will have bugs -- os/2 is not exempt, 	especially since ibm is constantly adding new features to os/2. 	so far, ibm has issued system patches and corrective service disks 	(e.g.  the service pak) for free (free from bbss and ftp sites, or 	for free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- read 	comp.os.os2.misc for details).   proposed charters:  	(a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)  		it will provide a forum for developers of ported software so 		as to coordinate efforts, avoid duplication of effort, and 		spur additional development.  the group will also cover 		topics such as porting from other platforms (such as dos, 		windows, unix, etc), toolkits which aid in program 		portability (including porting tools such as mirrors), and 		so forth.  	(b)  rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)  		to keep the structure of the os/2 newsgroup heirarchy 		orthogonal, comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to 		comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.  		comp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup 		for os/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and 		technical aspects of os/2 in an unmoderated setting.  	(c)  create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)  		it will be devoted to os/2 system setup topics, including the 		availability of device drivers, compatibility information, 		installation procedures, system requirements, and overall 		performance optimization.  	(d)  create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)  		it will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues.  	(e)  create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)  		it will provide a forum for os/2 system bug reports, bug 		diagnosis and work arounds, the availability of system 		patches and corrective service disks, and so forth.  		[note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other 		newsgroups, and discussion of bugs in os/2 betas belong in 		comp.os.os2.beta]   how to vote:  	to cast your vote, fill out the ballot below and e-mail it to me. 	many newsreaders will allow e-mail to be sent by replying to this 	post.  be sure to send only the ballot, and edit out the rest of 	this post.  	1)  type in your vote for

voting rules:  	* one vote per person.  if you vote more than once, only the most 	  recent vote will be counted.  	* votes must be mailed to me by the person voting.  proxy voting, 	  forwarding, posting votes to a newsgroup, etc. will not be counted.  	* do not ask how the votes are going.  the status of the votings 	  will be revealed only after the poll closes.  	* i will acknowledge votes by mass acknowledgement (ack).  i will 	  post the ack twice (see schedule below).  	* if you need help for using your editor, using e-mail, how 	  voting works in general, etc. then ask an expert at your site. 	  also see the ``how to create a new newsgroup'' article which is 	  posted to news.answers on a regular basis.  	* if you need any clarifications on voting procedures for this 	  cfv, send me e-mail at mlevis@ringer.cs.utsa.edu.  	* when the voting period is over (see schedule below), a proposal 	  passes if both of the following formulas are true: 	  1)  the number of yes votes exceeds the number of no votes 	      by at least 100 (i.e. yes >= no + 100, or yes - no >= 100). 	  2)  the number of yes votes exceeds at least twice the 	      number of no votes (i.e. yes >= 2 * no, or yes - no >= no). 	  in other words, a proposal passes if: 	      yes - no >= max (100, no) 	  where max() returns the highest number given to it.   schedule:  	the voting period started on march 29 when the first cfv was posted 	by david lawrence (the news.announce.newgroups moderator).  	this third cfv is a repeat of the first cfv, but it also has the 	mass acknowledgement (ack) of names and e-mail addresses of those who 	have already voted -- re-send your vote if it is not there.  if you 	have not voted yet, vote now!  	the voting period will end at 11:59:59 pm (central time), on 	april 24, 1993.  votes received after that time will not count. 	the voting results and tally will be posted shortly after that 	date.   mass acknowledgement:  	here is the list of people who have already sent in their ballots 	as of 12:01 am (central time) on april 15, 1993:                            bdubbs@cs.tamu.edu aiyagari, sanjay          ska1@crux3.cit.cornell.edu alcorn, justin

"<clip clip>   running ms-dos or a derivative os, obviously. please take note that the following is not what exactly happens, but a slightly simplified explanation.  technically, the irq line is only a means for the device (printer adapter, soundblaster, modem, hard disk, ...) to signal the cpu that ""something's happening here, please take note."" how the cpu is programmed to handle this signal is usually up to the operating system. in ms-dos, the ""interrupt vector"" is used to store the address of the function that handles each interrupt.  now, basic dos doesn't care whether the printer reports that it's ready to print some more stuff or not - it simply ignores the interrupt.  when dos prints, it looks at the lpt buffer.  if there's a character there, wait a while and check again.  if there's not, copy a new character to the lpt port.  since the irq 7 is ignored as a printer interrupt, it's free for use for any other adapters - in this case, the sb.   with any multitasking or otherwise advanced os, this kind of printing approach just doesn't work (or more precisely, it wastes a lot of cpu cycles.) hence, you can't ""share"" the irq 7 with lpt1 and sb if you're running unix or os/2 or whatnot.  another issue with the sb is that only the digitized sound uses interrupts. when the sb plays plain music, the cpu simply tells it what to play until told otherwise. with digitized sound the interrupt is required to notify the cpu when the output ends and new data is needed.  you can, however, hook two (or more) com ports to one interrupt, but use them only one at a time.  this is because the interrupt handling routine is same for both ports, and it can see from which port the data came from. this, of course, applies for some other devices (like lpt) as well.  remember, this was greatly simplified in parts, but i think gives the general picture correctly enough.  cheers,",3,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

"i would like to apologize for the typos in the previous post.  in retrospect i would also like to quote another source: douglas c. haldeman from his 1991 book _homosexuality_  therapy ineffective  recently the founders of yet another prominent ""ex-gay"" ministry, exodus international, denounced their conversion therapy procedures as ineffective. michael busse and gary cooper, cofounders of exodus international and lovers for 13 years, were involved with the organization from 1976 to 1979.  the program was described by these men as ""ineffective . . . not one person was healed.""  they stated that the program often exacerbated already prominent feelings of guilt and personal failure among the counselees; many were driven to suicidal thoughts as a result of the failed ""reparative therapy.""  the previous article quoted in the last posting is from the advocate, june 30, 1992 called ""the ex-ex-gay"" by robert pela.  some personal thoughts:  it is of no great astonishment that there is a concerted effort by a major portion of the church to control and mandate change of a minority among its ranks.  this was the momentum behind the spanish inquisition, only all they required was a confession of faith (after much torture) and then, to save their souls they would dispatch them to heaven through death.  even later, the bible was used vigorously to defend slavery, oppression and segragation of african-americans, even to the justification of lynchings. today's scholars are just a bit more slick in their approach.  the tool is still coersion, but now it is mostly by means of brainwashing and mind control, convincing people that they should see themselves as less than god sees them, then maintaining a cultic hold on them until it is felt thier mind-conditioning is complete.  sure, no one is ""physically"" forced to stay in this ""reparative therapy"" but sheer social pressure is enough for many to keep themselves in this new found bondage of self-hate.  as an abolitionist i advocate the abolishment of oppression and persecution against gays in all facets of civil life.  a person should be judged by the contibution, or non-contribution to the society in which they live, not by some high-brow standard of conformity imposed by those who haven';t a clue what is in their heart.  for those who seek more information about gays and groups that accept them please contact your nearest chapter of pflag (parents & friends of lesbians and gays) who will be more than happy to assist you.  this is a group of people comprised of gays, lesbians and bisexuals, their parents and friends who have formed a support group for help and understanding.  try talking to a parent of a gay son or daughter and learn some ""first-hand"" real life and loving understanding.  god's love and understanding for gay people is no less abundant.",19,talk.religion.misc
"clipper chip is a response to the fact that there is no business or professional body in a position to establish a standard and provide chipsets to implement it for analog or digial transmission systems.  rsa might be in position to do it, if they had active cooperation of a couple of manufacturers of cellular phones or desktop phones.  large companies in the voice/data comm business are out, because they all have contracts with the gov which would be used to pressure them.  if we, as professionals in crypto organizations, eff, etc. were to put our collective minds and interests toward establishing a crypto standard for transmission, and getting our companies to implement it, we might avoid government control.  otherwise, i think it will happen to us by default.  gov isn't probably strong enough or foolish enough to prevent strong crypt.  they are strong enough, and we may be foolish enough, to push through the clipper chip.  is rsa independt of the gov enough to spearhead this?  i, for one, would *gladly* pay royalties via purchasing secure phones.  if not this, we should provide an algorithm which can be implemented in either sw or hw and publish it, then push to make it the defacto standard in the way that pgp and ripem are becoming such.  we are opposing, charging the bunker.  we should be nimble and clever. the gov is strong, not clever.  lew",11,sci.crypt

"it's pretty complex, and cd isn't the whole story either.  cd for cars is usually calculated based on the frontal area of the car.  so a large car with a good cd could get the same drag force as a smaller car with a poorer cd.   to calculate drag use this formula:  d = 1/2 * rho * v^2 * cd * s  where d is the drag force (lbs), rho is the local air density (slugs/ft^3), v is the velocity (ft/s), and s is the frontal area (ft^2).  note that the pieces called 1/2 * rho * v^2 are sometimes called qbar or dynamic pressure (a fancy aero term for air pressure or force).   note that power is:  p = f * v  where p is power (lbf-ft/s), f is the force, drag in this case (lbf) and v is velocity (ft/s).   note that if you put the whole equation into one (by substituting d for force) you get a velocity _cubed_ term.  that's why huge increases in power result in little increases in speed.  ditto for decreases in cd.   so if you have a 100 mph car and reduce cd from .34 to .33, your new top speed is:  (sound of trumpet fanfare)  101 mph  sorry to dissappoint.",7,rec.autos

"i have had my probe looked at twice by my local dealer (where i purchased the car) ... the first time, they made this problem worse.  the second time, after advising them of the service bulletin mentioned on my ford-probe mailing list (they said they didn't know of the bulletin), they adjusted the window and made it *much* better.  however it now makes a ""scritch scritch"" noise on rough roads, and *still* squeals when i open/close the window in wet weather (anyone elses's do this?)   i got two keys with my car, but only one remote-entry push-button thingie! but then, i bought my 93 with 2500 miles, and  i think it may have been a repossession ... so i'm not surprised something was missing :-(   i am seriously considering following the advice in the owners manual where it describes the procedure to follow if ""you discover something on your ford that could ... cause ... serious injury ... threaten lives ... etc).  something about notifying the national traffic safety group as well as ford.  those little ""you've-got-to-position-the-fingers-perfectly-to-make-it-beep"" buttons are terrible.  well, i guess that's good in a way, but in a way it's bad.  when someone hears that kind of horn, they expect to see a big american car.  they may not associate the sound with a small ""jap car"" style car (like the probe is).   the mudflaps help a lot.   i have always been a 5-speed guy.  almost every car i've ever owned has been a 5-speed.  because i got a good deal on this car with the 2500 miles, i (knowingly) overlooked the fact that it has an automatic.  but it is a pretty high-tech automatic.  it is a fully electronicaly controlled 4-speed with torque converter lockup.  even with the automatic, i'm getting 35 mpg on the highway, driving 65-70!.    (but of course driving > 65 is illegal, so i  probably made that sentence up).  :-)     around town the mileage has been around 25-27, not bad for an automatic.   of course it doesn't have the ""control"" of a 5-speed, but since i do a lot of city driving, it turns out to be very convenient.  it's nice to be able to drink a cup of coffee and drive at the same time (although that, too, is illegal here in  ""we-like-to-control-your-life massachusetts"" :-)    shakes and rattles has been my main gripe.  i've gotten them to fix the worst of them, but i fear that with the rather harsh ride, the car will be a virtual potpouri of rattles when it gets older.   on my 89 probe gl, i got about 40k out of the original goodyears, and had driven the replacement tires (bridgestone) 50k miles when i tradeed the car.  the 195/65(60?)vr14 firestones on my 93 probe look like they're designed for performance (ie rather wide, shallow tread, etc), so they probably won't last as long.  but the car handles very very very well.  it sticks to the road like glue, even on a rough surface.   definitely.  ford/mazda did a very very nice job on this one.  the car has a ""much more expensive than it actually is"" look and feel to it.   having driven an 89 probe for 4 years, i find the 93 suspension ""interesting"". the car actually drives much better than the 89 ... it is a very firm ride, and you definitely know about each and every bump in the road.  yet the car remains very civilized on even the bumpiest roads.  you hear and feel the bumps, yet the car retains its posture very well.   well i wouldn't encourage passenger-carrying in the probe unless the person in the front seat likes to sit with his knees to the dash.  as mentioned in the consumer reports write-ups, ""consider the back seat as a parcel shelf"".  no biggie to me though (if it had been, i'd not have bought the car!  (but it's definitely not a family car)).   a/c is a must on any probe from 89 - 93.  the 93 in particular sends out a real blast of cool air when the ac is on max.  that ""lots of glass"" you mentioned is what gives the car the ""very good visibility"" reports you see in all the write-ups.  most ""sports/sporty"" cars don't have that good visibility.   the complaints i've heard re: exhaust system (on 93's) have been on  the gt.  of course being a different engine, that is a differeent  exhaust system.  i was one of those with an 89 who qualified for the free replacement. since i had already replaced the muffler when i received the notice,  i was/am due a refund from ford.  i applied in february and am still waiting.   :-(   yes.  i was pretty amazed when i had my car in for some touch-up adjustments this past week, and they had to keep it overnight (too busy for them to get to it) and they offered to pay for a rental).  they  did make me pay for taxes and insurance though :-(   i have to agree that they seem to have some qc problesm.  but i seriously feel the car design is sound, and expect it to do very well.",7,rec.autos

""love"" is a highly ambiguous word, of which christians can write both the ""gentle"" words paul uses of it in 1 corinthians -- in a passage that even the ""conservatives"" will quote at you :-) -- and the words of t. s. eliot in his pentacost hymn, ""love is the unfamiliar name that wove the intolerable shirt of flame ...""  this is in any case rather to the side of what i was attempting to raise in my note, as will become more evident below.   blechhh.  i think you are misreading me, rather seriously.  though, given my principle that one cannot force one's own notion of ""sin"" on another, and my unshakeable ""disestablishmentarianism"", russel turpin and others (believers and unbelievers alike) are under no threat of my legislating my own understanding of christian love.   you misread.  i can do (and have repeatedly done) a complete bill of accusation against the inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form as anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human beings (in the first place) and to respect for (let alone love of) ""god"" in near succession.  please go back to my quoted words above:  the ""possibility that always exists"" is that i (or, to revert to proper time sequence, my predecessors over the last several centuries) could persuade ""christian b"" of my case that the inquisition *does* indeed constitute an egregious violation of the law of love.  i must also note that the majority of christians have been so persuaded.  by christian argumentation, as well as by secular [both christian and non-christian] prohibitions.  what mr. turpin alludes to is a trickier point:  	a.  i demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved 	    in the inquisition.  	b.  the inquisitor responds that mother church must, however 	    painful this *seems*, ""discipline"" her children for their 	    own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or 	    if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example 	    ""deterring"" others from the same loss-of-soul.)  	a.  i point out that this ""justification"" of a failure in love 	    depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of 	    philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable.  	b.  burns me at the stake.  my rhetoric has failed, but the point i am making is sustained.  what is going on here has a *lot* to do with ""cultural baggage.""  in this case, the baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) belief that an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most believable if taken under torture.  the elimination of inqisitorial practice (in those places where it *has* been eliminated, or at least greatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussion of sin in the exchange between a and b.  mr. turpin is pointing out that, if i am a versus the grand inquisitor's b, then my persuasion is not very likely to work.  i know this; and in what- ever personal agony, i consign the issue to god and my ghostly defense attorney.  so, ""one possibility"" fails in this case -- as it will fail in may others.  at the other extreme, the ""persuasion"" will succeed when it properly should not, if it entails mistaken assumptions i share with the inquisitor.  and that is potentially an even more troubling case, in that many of the victims of inquisition will have ""accepted"" that they were in fact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty of charges brought against them.)  the point is that the ""persuasion"" breaks down when the parties do not share enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main thrust of the inquisition, against ""heresy"", it is *bound* to break down in precisely the ""worst"" cases.  the ""conservative"" (i don't think that is the right word, btw) will take refuge in what i attribute to b above, that he is ""justified"" in causing harm because he *thinks* that works to a ""greater good.""  but this is a violent and extravagant refusal to follow the gospel, as if one's theories about ""sin"" entitled one to cast aside jesus' words on dealing with sinners (cf. matthew 5:39ff).  i am a ""radical"" christian *only* in that i take the gospel seriously.   well, the whole *point* of making these the ""base"" commandments is that they *aren't* reducible to rules.  a set of rules is a moral code or a law code or an algorithm for acting.  such things can be very helpful to individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a personal involvement in and responsibility for one's actions.  the great commandment is, more than anything else, a call to act *as if you were god and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action.  a demand that i, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keeps popping up nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more important that i be open to trying this, than succeeding at it).  ""conservatives"" may twist this ""act as if you were god"" to mean ""lay down rules for other people and be as nasty to them as possible if they don't keep your rules."" they are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a lot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocy is how god acts.  that, after all, is the standard accusation ""against god"" by the atheists here and elsewhere.  that the ""conservatives"" have confused their manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing other people with the nature of god is almost the entire content of standard american atheism -- and i quite agree with it on this point.   and different bodies of christians have, from the beginning, urged *different* ""ethical systems"" (or in some cases, none).  as a result, it is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular (or infamous) with christianity.  christianity does not have a torah. it does not have a qu'ran.  specifically christian scripture has very little, if anything, in the way of ""commandments"" -- so little that the ""christians"" who desperately *want* commandments go ""mining"" for them with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-)) for their efforts.  the one, single, thing in the gospels which jesus specifically ""gives"" as ""a commandment"" to us is ""love one another.""  	[i will be expanding on this point in a reply to paul hudson 	 that i hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that 	 some christians infer lots of commandments from the nt; i'll 	 point out what has to be going on in these inferences, and why 	 there is a huge amount of ""cultural baggage"" involved.]  you are quite right that this is ""goo"" if one is looking for an ethical system.  but why should anyone be looking for an ethical system, since our society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?  it may be that we need a principle for the critique of ethical systems -- in which case i will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again.   i think you are begging the question. why don't i and the (myriads of) other christians like me tell you something about christianity? [nor is this very new in christianity -- you might want to look up the origins and fundamental doctrines of the quakers, from the 17th century onwards, and they are not at all the first to understand the gospel in a manner that is congenial to my case.]",19,talk.religion.misc

   the concept of identity is closely intertwined with communication,   privacy, and security, which in turn are all critical aspects of   computer networks. for example, the convenience of communication   afforded by email would be impossible without conventions for   identification.  but there are many potential abuses of identity   possible that can have very severe consequences, with massive   computer networks at the forefront of the issue, which can   potentially either exacerbate or solve these problems.    verifying that an identity is correct is called `authentication',   and one classic example of the problems associated with it is   h.g.well's ``war of the worlds'' radio broadcast that fooled   segments of the population into thinking that an alien invasion was   in progress.  hoaxes of this order are not uncommon on usenet and   forged identities makes them more insidious.  people and their   reputations can be assaulted by forgery.    however, the fluidity of identity on the internet is for some one of   its most attractive features. identity is just as useful as it is   harmful.  a professor might carefully explain a topic until he   finds he is talking to an undergraduate. a person of a particular   occupation may be able to converse with others who might normally   shun him.  some prejudices are erased, but, on the other hand, many   prejudices are useful!  a scientist might argue he can better   evaluate the findings of a paper as a reviewer if he knows more   about the authors.  likewise, he may be more likely to reject it   based on unfair or irrelevant criteria.  on the other side of the   connection,  the author may find identities of reviewers useful in   exerting pressure for acceptance.    identity is especially crucial in establishing and regulating   `credit' (not necessarily financial) and `ownership' and `usage'.    many functions in society demand reliable and accurate techniques   for identification. heavy reliance will be placed on digital   authentication as global economies become increasingly electronic.    many government functions and services are based on identification,   and law enforcement frequently hinges on it.  hence, employees of   many government organizations push toward stronger identification   structures.  but when does identification invade privacy?    the growth of the internet is provoking social forces of massive   proportions. decisions made now on issues of identity will affect   many future users, especially as the network becomes increasingly   global, universal, widespread, and entrenched; and the positive or   adverse affects of these actions, intended and inadvertent,  will   literally be magnified exponentially.  _____ <1.3> how does my email address (not) identify me and my background?    your email address may contain information that influences people's   perceptions of your background.  the address may `identify' you as   from a department at a particular university, an employee at a   company, or a government worker.  it may contain your last name,   initials, or cryptic identification codes independent of both.  in   the us some are based on parts of social security numbers.  others   are in the form 'u2338' where the number is incremented in the   order that new users are added to the system.    standard internet addresses  also can contain information  on your   broad geographical location or nationhood.  however, none of this   information is guaranteed to be correct or be there at all.  the   fields in the domain qualification of the username are based on   rather arbitrary organization, such as (mostly invisible) network   cabling distributions.  the only point to make is that early fields   in the address are more specific (such as specific computer names   or local networks) and the later ones the most general (such as   continental domains).  typically the first field is the name of the   computer receiving mail.    gleaning information from the email address alone is sometimes an   inspired art or an inconsistent and futile exercise.  (for more   information, see the faqs on email  addresses and known   geographical distributions below.)  however, unix utilities exist   to aid in the quest (see the question on this).    common suffixes   ---------------    .us    united states   .uk    united kingdom   .ca    canada   .fi    finland   .au    australia    .edu   university or college   .com   commercial organization   .org   'other' (e.g. nonprofit organization)   .gov   government   .mil   military site   _____ <1.4> how can i find out more about somebody with a given email address?    one simple way is to send email to that address, asking.  another   way is to send mail to the postmaster at that address (i.e.   postmaster@address), although the postmaster's job is more to help   find user id's of particular people given their real name and solve   mail routing problems.  the sysadmin (i.e. `root@address') may also   be able to supply information.  users with related email address   may have information.  however, all of these methods rely on the   time and patience of others so use them minimally.    one of the most basic tools for determining identity over the   internet is the unix utility 'finger'.  the basic syntax is:      finger user@here.there.everywhere    this utility uses communication protocols to query the computer   named in the address for information on the user named.  the   response is generated completely by the receiving computer and may   be in any format.  possible responses are as follows:    - a message `unknown host' meaning some aspect of the address is     incorrect, two lines with no information and '???'.      - a message 'in real life: ???' in which case the receiving computer     could not find any kind of a match on the username. the finger     utility may return this response in other situations.      - a listing of information associated with multiple users. some     computers will search only for matching user ids, others will     attempt to find the username you specified as a substring of all     actual full names of users kept in a local database.      at some sites 'finger' can be used to get a list of all users on the   system with a `finger @address'.  in general this is often   considered weak security, however, because `attackers' know valid   user id's to `crack' passwords.    more information on the fields returned by `finger' is given below.    more information on `finger' and locating people's email addresses   is given in the email faq (such as the whois lookup utility).  just   as you can use these means to find out about others, they can use   them to find out about you.  you can `finger' yourself to find out   what is publicly reported by your unix system about you.  be   careful when modifying `finger' data; virtually anyone with   internet access worldwide can query this information.  in one   amazing case, the new york times writer j. markoff uncovered the   identity of r. morris, author of the internet worm,  through   the use of an anonymous tip and 'finger'.  see the book cyberspace   by k. hafner and j. markoff.  _____ <1.5> why is identification (un)stable on the internet?    generally, identity is an amorphous and almost nonexistent concept   on the internet for a variety of reasons.  one is the inherent   fluidity of `cyberspace' where people emerge and submerge   frequently, and absences are not readily noted in the `community'.    most people remember faces and voices, the primary means of casual   identification in the 'real world'.  the arbitary and cryptic    sequences of letters and digits comprising most email addresses are   not particularly noticeable or memorable and far from a unique   identification of an individual, who may use multiple accounts on   multiple machines anywhere in the world.    currently internet users do not really have any great assurances   that the messages in email and usenet are from who they appear to   be. a person's mailing address is far from an identification of an   individual.        - anyone with access to the account, e.g. they know the password,     either legitimately or otherwise, can send mail with that address     in the from: line.      - email addresses for an individual tend to change frequently as     they switch jobs or make moves inside their organizations.     - as part of current mailing protocol standards, forging the from:     line in mail messages is a fairly trivial operation for many     hackers.        the status and path information prepended to messages by   intermediate hosts is generally unforgeable. in general, while   possible, forgeries are fairly rare on most newsgroups and in   email.  besides these pathological cases abve there are many basic   problems with today's internet protocols affecting identification   on the internet:    - internet mail standards, described in rfc-822, are still evolving     rapidly and not entirely orderly.  for example, standards for     mail address `munging' or `parsing' tend to vary slightly between     sites and frequently mean the difference between finding     addresses and bouncing mail.      - domain names and computer names are frequently changed at sites,     and there are delays in the propagation of this data.      - addresses cannot be resolved when certain critical computers     crash, such as the receiving computer or other computers involved     in resolving names into addresses called `nameservers'.       - a whole slew of problems is associated with  `nameservers'; if     they are not updated they will not find name addresses, and even     the operation of what constitutes `updating' has different     interpretations at different sites.      the current internet mailing and addressing protocols are slightly   anachronistic in that they were created when the network was   somewhat obscure and not widespread, with only a fraction of the   traffic it now sees.  today a large proportion of internet traffic   is email, comprising  millions of messages.  _____ <1.6> what is the future of identification on the internet?    some new technologies and standards are introducing facial images   and voice messages  into mail and these will improve the sense of   community that comes from the familiarity of identification.   however, they are not currently widespread, require large amounts   of data transfer, standardized software, and make some compromises   in privacy.    promising new cryptographic techniques may make 'digital signatures'   and 'digital authentication' common (see below).  also, the trend   in usenet standards is toward greater authentication of posted   information.  on the other hand, advances in ensuring anonymity   (such as remailers) are forthcoming.  see below.   privacy =======  _____ <2.1> what is `privacy' on the internet?    generally, while `privacy' has multiple connotations in society and   perhaps even more on the internet, in cyberspace most take it to   mean that you have exclusive use and access to your account and the   data stored on and and directed to it (such as email), and you do   not encounter arbitrary restrictions or searches.  in other words,    others may obtain data associated with your account, but not   without your permission.  these ideas are probably both fairly   limiting and liberal in their scope in what most internet users   consider their private domains.  some users don't expect or want   any privacy, some expect and demand it.  _____ <2.2> why is privacy (un)important on the internet?    this is a somewhat debatable and inflammatory topic, arousing   passionate opinions.  on the internet, some take privacy for   granted and are rudely surprised to find it tenuous or nonexistent.   most governments have rules that protect privacy (such as the   illegal search and seizure clause of the u.s. constitution, adopted   by others) but have many that are antithetical to it (such as laws   prohibiting secret communications or allowing wiretapping). these   rules generally carry over to the internet with few specific rules   governing it.  however, the legal repercussions of the global   internet are still largely unknown and untested (i.e. no strong   legal precedents and court cases).  the fact that internet traffic   frequently passes past international boundaries, and is not   centrally managed, significantly complicates and strongly   discourages its regulation.  _____ <2.3> how (in)secure are internet networks?    - `theoretically' people at any site in the chain of sites with     access to hardware and network media that transmits data over the     internet  could potentially monitor or archive it. however, the     sheer volume and general 'noise' inherent to this data makes     these scenarios highly improbable, even by government agencies     with supposedly vast funding and resources.      - technologies exist to `tap' magnetic fields given off by     electrical wires without detection.  less obscurely, any machine     with a network connection is a potential station for traffic     detection, but this scenario requires knowledge and access to     very low-level hardware (the network card) to pursue, if even     possible.      - a company network general inc. is one of many that manufactures     and markets sophisticated network monitoring tools that can     'filter' and read packets by arbitrary criteria for     troubleshooting purposes, but the cost of this type of device is     prohibitive for casual use.    known instances of the above types of security  breaches at a major   scale (such as at network hubs) are very rare. the greatest risks   tend to emerge locally.  note that all these approaches are almost   completely defused with the use of cryptography.      _____ <2.4> how (in)secure is my account?    by default, not very.  there are a multitude of factors that may   reinforce or compromise aspects of your privacy on the internet.    first, your account must be secure from other users. the universal   system is to use a password, but if it is `weak' (i.e. easy to   guess) this security is significantly diminished.  somewhat   surprisingly and frighteningly to some, certain  users of the   system, particularly the administrator, generally have unlimited   access regardless of passwords, and may grant that access to   others.  this means that they may read any file in your account   without detection.    furthermore, not universally known, most unix systems keep fairly   extensive accounting records of when and where you logged in, what   commands you execute, and when they are executed (in fact, login   information is usually public). most features of this `auditing' or    `process accounting' information are enabled by default after the   initial installation and the system administrator may customize it   to strengthen or weaken it to satisfy performance or privacy aims.    this information is frequently consulted for troubleshooting   purposes and may otherwise be ignored.  this data tracks   unsuccessful login attempts and other 'suspicious' activities on   the system. a traditional part of the unix system that tracks user   commands is easily circumvented by the user with the use of   symbolic links (described  in 'man ln').      unix implementations vary widely particularly in tracking features   and new sophisticated mechanisms are introduced by companies   regularly. typically system adminstrators augment the basic unix   functionality with public-domain programs and locally-developed   tools for monitoring, and use them only to isolate `suspicious'   activity as it arises (e.g. remote accesses to the 'passwd' file, incorrect   login attempts, remote connection attempts, etc.).      generally, you should expect little privacy on your account for   various reasons:      - potentially, every keystroke you type could be intercepted by     someone else.     - system administrators make extensive backups that are completely     invisible to users which may record the states of an account over     many weeks.     - erased files can, under many operating systems, be undeleted.     - most automated services keep logs of use for troubleshooting or     otherwise; for example ftp sites usually log the commands and     record the domain originations of users, including anonymous     ones.    - some software exacerbates these problems.  see the section on     ``x windows (in)security''.    indepedent of malevolent administrators are fellow users, a much   more commonly harmful threat. there are multiple ways to help   ensure that your account will not be accessed by others, and   compromises can often be traced to failures in these guidelines:    - choose a secure password.  change it periodically.   - make sure to logout always.   - do not leave a machine unattended for long.   - make sure no one watches you when you type your password.   - avoid password references in email.   - be conservative in the use of the .rhost file.   - use utilities like `xlock' to protect a station, but be     considerate.    be wary of situations where you think you should supply your   password.  there are only several basic situations where unix   prompts you for a password: when you are logging in to a system or   changing your password.  situations can arise in which prompts for   passwords are forged by other users, especially in cases where you   are talking to them (such as internet relay chat).  also, be  aware   that forged login screens are one method to illegitimately obtain    passwords.     (thanks to jim mattson <mattson@cs.ucsd.edu> for contributions   here.)  _____ <2.5> how (in)secure are my files and directories?    the most important privacy considerations are related to file   rights, and many lapses can be traced to their misunderstood nature   or haphazard maintenance. be aware of the rights associated with   your files and directories in unix. if the `x' (`execute') right on   your parent directory is off for users, groups, and other, these   users cannot gain information on anything in your directories.    anything less may allow others to read, change, or even delete   files in your home directory. the rights on a directory supersede   the rights associated with files in that directory. for a   directory, 'x' means that access to the files (or subdirectories)   in the directory is possible -- if you know their names.  to list   the contents of the directory, however, requires the 'r' right.     by default most accounts are accessable only to the owner, but the   initial configuration varies between sites based on administrator   preference.  the default file mode specifies the initial rights   associated with newly created files, and can be set in the shell   with `umask'.  the details of rights implementations tend to vary   between versions of unix.  consult man pages on `chmod' and `ls'.    examples   --------      traver.lance % ls -ld ~     drwx------ 15 ld231782     1536 jan 31 21:22 /users/ld231782/    here is a listing of the rights associated with a user's home   directory, denoted by `~'.  the columns at the left identify what   rights are available. the first column identifies the entry as a   directory, and the next three columns mean that read, write, and   execute rights, respectively, are permitted for that user.  for   directories, the `x' right means that contents (file and   subdirectory names) within that directory can be listed. the   subsequent columns indicate that no other users have any rights to   anything in the directory tree originating at that point.  they   can't even `see' any lower files or subdirectories; the hierarchy   is completely invisible to them.      traver.lance % ls -l msg     -rw-r--r--  1 ld231782   35661 jan 29 23:13 msg     traver.lance % chmod u=rw,g=,o= msg     traver.lance % ls -l msg     -rw-------  1 ld231782   35661 jan 29 23:13 msg    here the modes on the file `msg' were changed to take away rights   from `group' and `other'.       note that `ls -l <file>' requires both the 'r' right to get the list   of files and subdirectories, and the 'x' right to access the files   and subdirectories in order to get their size, etc. for example,   suppose the directory `foo' has rights dr--r--r--,  the following   is possible:      ls foo    these commands would fail independent of file rights:        ls -l foo     ls -l foo/file     cat foo/file     cd foo    if the directory `foo' has rights d--x--x--x, the following are   possible if it is known beforehand that `foo' contains an 'r'   readable file named `file':        ls -l foo/file     cat foo/file     cd foo      the following commands fail:        ls foo     ls -l foo       (thanks to uwe waldmann <uwe@mpi-sb.mpg.de> for contributions here.)  _____ <2.6> how (in)secure is x windows?    x windows is the primary software developed by the mit athena   project which is funded by u.s. government grants to develop   applications to harness the power of networks in enhancing   computational tasks, particularly the human-computer interface.    the software implements a client-server interface to a computer via   graphical windows. in this case the `client' is the application   requesting or utilizing  graphical resources (such as windows or a   mouse) and the `server' is the machine that provides them.  in many   situations the client is an application program running on the same   machine as the server.    the great utility of x windows comes from its complete dissociation   of the client and server so that windows may be `broadcast' to a   server at a remote location from the  client. unfortunately this   dynamic power also introduces many deep, intricate, and complicated   security considerations.  the primary security and privacy issue   associated with x windows is that much more sensitive data may be   sent over a network, and over wider regions, than in the case where   the human is situated near the host computer.  currently there is   no encryption of data such as screen updates and keystrokes in x   windows.    due to either intentional design decisions or unintentional design   flaws,  early versions of the x window system are extremely   insecure. anyone with an account on the server machine can disrupt   that display or read it electronically based on access to the   device unix:0.0 by any regular user.   there are no protections   from this type of access in these versions.   the problem arises   because the security is completely based on machine addresses   rather than users, such that any user at a `trusted' machine is   himself trusted. quoting from x documentation (man xsecurity):      > any client on a host in the host access control list is allowed   > access to the x server. this system can work reasonably well in   > an environment where everyone trusts everyone, or when only a   > single person can log into a given machine...this system does not   > work well when multiple people can log in to a single machine and   > mutual trust does not exist.       with the access control list, the `xhost' command may prevent some   naive attempts (i.e. those other than the direct-access unix:0.0   evasion); the syntax as typed on the host machine is  ``xhost   +[name]'' where [name] is the domain name or internet address of an   authorized client machine. by default clients running nonlocal to   the host are disabled.  public domain programs to disrupt a display   momentarily (such as 'flip' or slowly mirror the screen image, or   cause pixels to 'melt' down to the bottom) have been circulating on   the internet among hackers for several years and played as pranks   on unsuspecting or inexperienced users.  much more serious security   breaches are conceivable from similar mechanisms exploiting this   inherent weaknesses.  (the minimal, easily-bypassed `trusted'   security mode of `xhost' has been jokingly referred to as ``x   hanging open, security terrible.'').     new versions of the x window system (x11r5 and higher) by default    make server access as secure as the file system using a .xauthority   file and 'magic cookies'.  remote machines must have a code in the   .xauthority file in the home directory that matches the code   allowed by the server.  many older programs and even new   vendor-supplied code does not support or is incompatible with   `magic cookies'. the basic magic cookie mechanism is vulnerable to   monitoring techniques described earlier because no encryption of   keys occurs in transmission.  x11r5 also includes other   sophisticated encryption mechanisms.  try `man xsecurity' to find   out what is supported at your site.  even though improved security    mechanisms have been available in x windows since ~1990, local   sites often update this software infrequently because installation   is extremely complex.

(the debate persists endlessly on   many newsgroups whether this is also used  as a questionable means   of attacking or silencing `harmless crackpots' or censoring   unpopular opinions.)      system administrators at remote sites regularly cooperate to   'squelch' severe cases of abuse.  in general, however, by tradition   usenet readers are remarkably tolerant of diverse views and uses of   the system, but a colorful vocabularly of slang helps describe   their alternatives when this patience is sapped: the options   wielded by the individual user are to simply advance to the next   message (referred to as ``hitting the `n' key''), or to `plonk'   annoying posters (according to the hacker's dictionary, the sound a   jerk makes at the end of a fall to the bottom of a kill file).    in cases where punitive actions are applied, generally system   administrators are least likely to restrict email.  usenet postings   are much more commonly restricted, either to individual users or    entire groups (such as a university campus).  restrictions are most   commonly associated with the following `abuses':    - harassing or threatening notes, `email terrorism'   - illegal uses, e.g. piracy or propagation of copyrighted material   - `ad hominem' attacks, i.e. insulting the reputation of the     poster instead of citing the content of the message   - intentional or extreme vulgarity and offensiveness   - inappropriate postings, esp. binary files in regular groups     `mail-bombing': inundating mail boxes with numerous or massive     files    major problems originate from lack of distinctions in private and   official email or postings.  most users have internet access via   accounts at businesses or universities and their activities on the   internet can be construed as representative of their parent   organizations. many people put disclaimers in their `signatures' in   an attempt dissociate their identity and activities from parent   organizations as a precaution. a recent visible political case   involves the privacy of electronic mail  written by white house   staff members of the bush administration.  following are some   guidelines:    - acquaint yourself with your company or university policy.   - if possible, avoid use of your company email address for private     communication.   - use a disclaimer.   - keep a low profile (avoid `flamewars' or simply don't post).   - avoid posting information that could be  construed to be     proprietary or `internal'.    the following references are available from ftp.eff.com   (see also the section on ``internet use policies''):    /pub/academic/banned.1991   /pub/academic/banned.1992   ---     computer material that was banned/challenged in academia in 1991     and 1992 including usenet hierarchies.    /pub/academic/cases   ---     this is an on-line collection of information about specific     computers and academic freedom cases. file readme is a detailed     description of the items in the directory.    /pub/academic/faq/netnews.liability   ---     notes on university liability for usenet.  _____ <2.9> how do i provide more/less information to others on my identity?    the public information of your identity and account is mostly   available though the unix utility `finger' described above.       - you have control over most of this information with the utility     `chfn', the specifics vary between sites (on some systems use     `passwd -f').       - you can provide unlimited information in the .plan file which is     copied directly to the destination during the fingering.         - a technique that works at some sites allows you to find out who is     'finger'ing you and even to  vary the .plan file sent to them.        - your signature is determined by the environment variable signature        - usenet signatures are conventionally stored in the .signature file     in your home directory.        providing less information on your online identity is more difficult   and involved.  one approach is to ask your system adminstrator to   change or delete information about you (such as your full name).    you may be able to obtain access on a public account or one from   someone unrelated to you personally.  you may be able to remotely   login (via modem or otherwise) to computers that you are not   physically near.  these are tactics for hiding or masking your   online activities but nothing is foolproof.  consult man pages on   the 'chmod' command and the default file mode.  generally, files on   a shared system have good safeguards within the user pool but very   little protection is possible from corrupt system administrators.    to mask your identity in email or on usenet you can use different   accounts. more untraceable are new `anonymous posting' and   remailing services that are very recently being established.  see   below.  ______ <2.10> who is my sysadmin?  what does s/he know about me?    the requirements and screening for getting a system administration   job (and thereby access to all information on a system) vary widely   between sites and are sometimes frighteningly lax, especially at   universities.  many unix systems at universities are largely   managed by undergraduates with a background in computing and often   `hacking'.  in general, commercial and industrial sites are more   strict on qualifications and background, and government sites are   extremely strict.    the system adminstrator (root user) can monitor what commands you   used and at what times.  s/he may have a record (backups) of files   on your account over a few weeks. s/he can monitor when  you send   email or post usenet messages, and potentially read either.  s/he   may have access to records indicating what hosts you are using,   both locally and elsewhere.  administrators sometimes employ   specialized programs to  track `strange' or `unusual' activity,   which can potentially be misused.  ______ <2.11> why is privacy (un)stable on the internet?    for the numerous reasons listed above, privacy should not be an   expectation with current use of the internet.  furthermore, large   parts of the internet are funded by the u.s. nsf (national science   foundation) which places certain restrictions on its use (such as   prohibiting commercial use).  some high-level officials in this and   other government agencies may be opposed to emerging techniques to   guarantee privacy (such as encryption and anonymous services).    historically the major threats to privacy on the internet have been   local. perhaps the most common example of this are the widespread   occurrences of university administrators refusing to carry some   portion of usenet newsgroups labelled as `pornographic'. the   `alternative' hierarchy in the usenet system, which has virtually   no restrictions on propagation and new group creation, is   frequently targeted (although this material may appear anywhere).    from the global point of view traffic is generally completely   unimpeded on the internet  and only the most egregious offenders   are pursued.  for example,  verbatim transcriptions of copyrighted   material (such as newspaper or magazine articles) are posted to   usenet with regularity without major consequences (some email   complaints may ensue).  more astonishing to some is that currently   significant portions of usenet traffic, and less so internet   traffic, is comprised of sexually-explicit digitized images almost   entirely originating from copyrighted material (newsgroups such as   `alt.sex' regularly have the  highest traffic).    ______ <2.12> what is the future of privacy on the internet?    some argue that the internet currently has an adequate or   appropriate level of privacy.  others will argue that as a   prototype for future global networks it has woefully inadequate   safeguards.  the internet is growing to become a completely global,   international superhighway for data, and this traffic will   inevitably entail data such as voice messages, postal mail, and   many other items of extremely personal nature. computer items that   many people consider completely private (such as their local hard   drives) will literally be inches from global network connections.   also, sensitive industrial and business information is exchanged   over networks currently and this volume may conceivably merge with   the internet.      most would agree that, for these basic but sensitive uses of the   internet, no significant mechanisms are currently in place to   ensure much privacy. new standards are calling for uniform   introduction of `privacy enhanced mail' (pem) which uses encryption   technologies to ensure privacy, so that privacy protection is   automatic, and may significantly improve safeguards.    the same technology that can be extremely destructive to privacy   (such as with  surreptitious surveilance) can be overwhelmingly   effective in protecting  it (e.g. with encryption). some government   agencies are opposed to unlimited privacy in general, and believe   that it should lawfully be forfeited in cases of criminal conduct   (e.g. court-authorized wiretapping).  however, powerful new   technologies to protect privacy on computers are becoming   increasingly popular, provoking some to say that ``the cat is out   of the bag'' and the ``genie can't be put back in the bottle''.  in   less idiomatic terms, they believe that the spread of strong   cryptography is already underway will be socially and technically   unstoppable.      to date, no feasible system that guarantees both secure   communication and government oversight has been proposed (the two   goals are largely incompatible). proposals for ``registration'' of   secret keys (by d. denning on sci.crypt, for example) have been met   with hot controversy at best and ridicule and derision at worst,   mainly because of concerns for the right to privacy and objections   of inherent feasibility.  electronic privacy issues, and   particularly the proper roles of networks and the internet, will   foreseeably become highly visible and explosive over the next few   years.   anonymity =========  _____ <3.1> what is `anonymity' on the internet?    simply stated, anonymity is the absence of identity, the   ultimate in privacy. however, there are several variations on   this simple theme.  a person may wish to be consistently   identified by a certain pseudonym or `handle' and establish a   reputation under it in some area, providing pseudo-anonymity.   a person may wish to be completely untraceable for a single   one-way message (a sort of `hit-and-run'). or, a person may   wish to be openly anonymous but carry on a conversation with   others (with either known or anonymous identities) via an   `anonymous return address'.  a user may wish to appear as a   `regular user' but actually be untraceable.  sometimes a user   wishes to hide who he is sending mail to (in addition to the   message itself). the anonymous item itself may be directed at   individuals or groups.  a user may wish to access some   service and hide all  signs of the association.       all of these uses are feasible on the internet but are currently   tricky to carry out in practice, because of all the tracking   mechanisms inherent to operating systems and network protocols.    officials of the nsf and other government agencies may be opposed   to any of these uses because of the potential for abuse.    nevertheless, the inherent facelessness of large networks will   always guarantee a certain element of anonymity.  _____ <3.2> why is `anonymity' (un)important on the internet?    anonymity is another powerful tool that can be beneficial or   problematic depending on its use.  arguably absence of   identification is important as the presence of it.  it may be the   case that many strong benefits from electronic anonymity will be   discovered that were unforeseen and unpredicted, because true   anonymity has been historically very difficult to establish.    one can use anonymity to make personal statements to a colleague   that would sabotage a relationship if stated openly (such as   employer/employee scenarios).  one can use it to pass information   and evade any threat of direct retribution.  for example,   `whistleblowers' reporting on government abuses (economic, social,   or  political) can bring issues to light without fear of stigma or   retaliation. sensitive, personal, potentially damaging information   is often posted to some usenet groups, a risky situation where   anonymity allows conversations to be carried on completely   independent of the identities of the participants.  some police   departments run phone services that allow anonymous reporting of   crimes; such uses would be straightforward on the network.   unfortunately, extortion and harassment become more insidious with   assurances of anonymity.  _____ <3.3> how can anonymity be protected on the internet?    the chief means, as alluded to above, are masking identities in   email and posting. however, anonymous accounts (public accounts as   accessable and anonymous as e.g. public telephones) may be   effective as well, but this use is generally not officially   supported and even discouraged by some system adminstrators and nsf   guidelines.  the nonuniformity in the requirements of obtaining   accounts at different sites and institutions makes anonymous   accounts generally difficult to obtain to the public at large.    many communications protocols are inherently detrimental to   anonymity.  virtually every protocol in existence currently   contains information on both sender and receiver in every packet.   new communications protocols will likely develop that guarantee   much higher degrees of secure anonymous communication.  _____ <3.4> what is `anonymous mail'?    one approach to `anonymizing' mail has been to set up an `anonymous   server' that, when activated by email to its address, responds by   allocating and supplying an `anonymous id' that is unique to the   person requesting it (based on his email address).  this will vary   for the same person for different machine address email   originations. to send anonymous mail, the user sends email directed   to the server containing the final destination. the server   `anonymizes' the message by stripping of identification information   and forwards the message, which appears to originate from the   anonymous server only from the corresponding anonymous user id.    this is the `interactive' use of anonymity or pseudonymity   mentioned above.    another more `fringe' approach is to run a `cypherpunk' remailer   from a regular user account (no root system privileges are   required). these are currently being pioneered by  eric hughes and   hal finney <hal@alumni.caltech.edu>. the operator runs a process on   a machine that anonymizes mail sent to him with certain   characteristics that distinguish it from his regular incoming mail   (typically fields in the header). one has been implemented as a    perl script running on unix.  several of these are in existence   currently but sites and software currently are highly unstable;   they may be in operation outside of system administrator knowledge.   the remailers don't generally support anonymous return addresses.    mail that is incorrectly addressed is received by the operator.    generally the user of the remailer has to disavow any   responsibility for the messages forwarded through his system,   although actually may be held liable regardless.    these approaches have several serious disadvantages and weaknesses:      - the anonymous server approach requires maintaining a mapping of     anonymous id's to real addresses that must be maintained     indefinitely.  one alternative is to allow `deallocation' of     aliases at the request of the user, but this has not been     implemented yet.    - although an unlikely scenario, traffic to any of these sites could     conceivably be monitored from the `outside', necessitating the     use of cryptography for basic protection,.    - local administrators can shut them down either out of caprice or     under pressure from local, network, or government agencies.      - unscrupulous providers of the services can monitor the traffic     that goes through them.    - most remailers currently keep logs that may be inspected.     - the cypherpunk approach tends to be highly unstable because these     operators are basically  network users who do not own the     equipment and are accountable  to their own system     administrators, who may be unaware of the use and unsympathetic     to the philosophy of anonymity when the operation is discovered,     regarding it as illicit use.     - in all cases, a high degree of trust is placed in the anonymous     server operator by the user.    currently the most direct route to anonymity involves using smtp   protocols to submit a message directly to a server with arbitrary   field information.  this practice, not uncommon to hackers, and the   approach used by remailers, is generally viewed with hostility by   most system administrators.  information in the header routing data   and logs of network port connection information may be retained   that can be used to track the originating site.  in practice, this   is generally infeasible and rarely carried out.  some   administrators on the network will contact local administrators to   request a message be tracked and its writer admonished or punished   more severely (such as revoking the account), all of this actually   happening occasionally but infrequently.    see the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and    ``responsibilities associated with anonymity''.  _____ <3.5> what is `anonymous posting'?    anonymous servers have been established as well for anonymous usenet   posting with all the associated caveats above (monitored traffic,   capricious or risky local circumstances, logging).  make sure to   test the system at least once by e.g. anonymous posting to   misc.test (however some operators don't recommend this because many   sites `autorespond' to test messages, possibly causing the   anonymous server to allocate anonymous ids for those machines).    see the ``responsibilties associated with anonymous posting''   before proceeding.    another direct route involves using nntp protocols to submit a   message directly to a newserver with arbitrary field information.   this practice, not uncommon to hackers, is also generally viewed   with hostility by most system administrators, and similar   consequences can ensue.    see the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and    ``responsibilities associated with anonymity''.  _____ <3.6> why is anonymity (un)stable on the internet?    as noted, many factors compromise the anonymity currently available   to the general internet community, and these services should be   used with great caution.  to summarize, the technology is in its   infancy and current approaches are unrefined, unreliable, and not   completely trustworthy.  no standards have been established and   troubling situations of loss of anonymity and bugs in the software   are prevalent.  here are some encountered and potential bugs:       - one  anonymous remailer reallocated already allocated anonymous     return addresses.    - others passed signature information embedded in messages     unaltered.    - address resolution problems resulting in anonymized mail bounced     to a remailer are common.   - forgeries to the anonymous server itself are a problem,  possibly     allowing unauthorized users to potentially glean anon id - email     address  mappings in the alias file.  this can be remedied with     the use of passwords.   - infinite mail loops are possible with chaining remailers.      source code is being distributed, tested, and refined for these   systems, but standards are progressing slowly and weakly.  the   field is not likely to improve considerably without  official   endorsement and action by network agencies.  the whole idea is   essentially still in its infancy and viewed with suspicion and   distrust by many on the internet, seen as illegitimate or favorable   to criminality.  the major objection to anonymity over regular   internet use  is the perceived lack of accountability to system   operators, i.e. invulnerability to account restrictions resulting   from outside complaints.  system adminstrators at some sites have   threatened to filter anonymous news postings generated by the   prominent servers from their redistribution flows.  this may only   have the effect of encouraging server operators to create less   characteristically detectable headers.  probably the least   problematic approach, and the most traditional to usenet, is for   individual users to deal with anonymous mail however they prefer,   e.g. ignoring it or filtering it with kill files.    _____ <3.7> what is the future of anonymity on the internet?    new anonymous protocols effectively serve to significantly increase   safeguards of anonymity.  for example, the same mechanism that   routes email over multiple hosts, thereby threatening its privacy,   can also be used to guarantee it. in a scheme called `chaining' an   anonymous message is passed through multiple anonymous servers   before reaching a destination.  in this way generally multiple   links of the chain have to be `broken' for security to be   compromised. re-encryption at each link makes this scenario even   more unlikely.  even more significantly the anonymous remailers   could be spread over the internet globally so that local weaknesses   (such as corrupt governments or legal wiretapping within a nation)   would be more unlikely to sacrifice overall security by message   tracing. however, remailers run by corrupt operators are possible.      the future of anonymous services on the internet is, at this time,   highly uncertain and fraught with peril. while specific groups seem   to benefit significantly from anonymous posting capabilities, many   feel that unlimited newsgroup scope for anonymous posting is a   disruptive and dangerous idea and detracts from discussions in   `serious' groups.   the introduction of unlimited group anonymity   may have fundamental repercussions on usenet conventions and   distribution mechanisms such as moderated and `alt' groups have had   in the past. for example, as part of new group creation, the   charter may specify whether `anonymous' posting is (un)welcome.     nevertheless, the widespread introduction and use of anonymity may   be inevitable. based on traffic statistics, anonymous services are   in huge demand. pervasive and readily available anonymity could   carry significant and unforeseen social consequences.  however, if   its use is continued to be generally regarded as subversive it may   be confined to the underground.  the ramifications of widespread   introduction of anonymity to usenet are still largely unknown. it   is unclear whether it will provoke signficant amounts of new   traffic or, instead of expansion, cause a shift where a greater   portion of existing traffic is anonymized.  conceivably the   services could play a role in influencing future mainstream social   acceptance of usenet.   * * *",11,sci.crypt

"(deletion)   the reference to it's not yet being ethics is dubious. you have used the terms absolute, objective and others interchangeably. same with moral values, values, at all, worth, measuers, and usefulness. you infer from them as if they were the same.   to the if. when the if is not fulfilled, your intermission is a waste of time. assuming that you don't intend this, it is reasonable to conclude that you want to argue a point.   you have made a interesting statement here, namely that of the disinterested observer. there is no such thing in morals. probably the shortest proof for objective and morality being a contradiction.       fine. and that freedom is valuable is not generally agreed upon. i could name quite a lot of people who state the opposite. (not that that wasn't mentioned before). in other words, you have nothing to fulfill your strong claims with.       clutching a straw. i don't believe in mappings into metaphysical sets were loaded terms are fixpoints. those who deny the morality of freedom make quite clear what they say, their practice is telling. yes, there are even those who are willingly unfree. it is quite common in religions, by the way. for one, there is a religion which is named submission.   don't even try to argue that submission is freedom.       if it were so, it would argue my case. but i am afraid that that is considered proof.",0,alt.atheism
"think about what you are saying here. the 24 bit image is quantised down to 8 bits so many 'similar' colours are mapped onto a single palette colour. this colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways. you then want to apply these modifications back to the 24 bit file, so you have to find which colours mapped to this one palette colour. ok you could do this by copying the 24 bit file to a 32 bit file and using the extra 8 bits to hold the index entry.  having done this, you need to do something to them ... what, exactly?  apply the difference in rgb between the original and modified palette entry to each colour in the group? this could generate colours with rgb outside the range 0...255. it would also lead to discontinuities when different parts of a smooth colour gradient mapped to several different palette entries.  you could interpolate from full modification to no modification depending how far each colour was from the palette entry. however i suspect this would look rather odd.  so in summary, what i said in my previous posting still holds:    in other words, to edit a 24 bit file you need software built for the job. tacking mods onto xv is going to create more problems than it solves.  as to the other bits - you seemed to be claiming that there were bugs in xv. if that was not what you meant, then:   yes, i probably did. i found that the collected digest format of your posting made it a little difficult to understand precisely what your point was. sorry if i misunderstood.   yes again. what *is* (was?) wrong with xv?  -- chris lilley ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- technical author, itti computer graphics and visualisation training project computer graphics unit, manchester computing centre, oxford road,  manchester, uk.  m13 9pl                        internet: c.c.lilley@mcc.ac.uk  voice: +44 (0)61 275 6045  fax: +44 (0)61 275 6040 janet: c.c.lilley@uk.ac.mcc",1,comp.graphics

"04/16/93 1045  armenia says it could shoot down turkish planes  by david ljunggren  moscow, april 16, reuter - armenia accused turkey on friday of flying weapons x and troops across armenian airspace to azerbaijan and strongly hinted it might try to shoot the planes down, local journalists in yerevan said.  separately, itar-tass news agency said armenian forces had halted their latest offensive which has swallowed up one-tenth of azerbaijan and sent tensions in the transcaucasian region soaring.  the journalists in the armenian capital quoted armen duliyan, head of the armenian defence ministry press centre, as saying ankara had been sending  planes up to 15 times a day to azerbaijan with arms and troops.  it looks as though the armenian leadership will have to warn turkey about the impermissibility of such actions,"" the journalists quoted duliyan as  saying.  ""if such steps are pursued in the future we will have recourse to appropriate measures. we have all the necessary means, including modern anti-aircraft units.""  turkey, which shares a border with armenia, has supported azerbaijan in the conflict over the mainly armenian-populated nagorno-karabakh region in which more than 2,500 people have been killed since fighting erupted in 1988.  the turkish foreign ministry said on friday it had so far sent one plane to azerbaijan containing humanitarian aid.  a turkish foreign ministry spokesman on thursday would not comment directly on a report by hurriyet newspaper that a first consignment of rockets, rocket launchers, ammunition and light weapons had arrived in azerbaijan from turkey.  duliyan said turkey had been sending up to 30 trucks a day carrying troops and arms to the bordering azeri autonomous territory of nakhichevan, from where they were flown across armenian airspace to the azeri capital baku.  ""all the responsibility for possible consequences will be borne by the country which is affording military assistance over our airspace,"" he said.  armenia denies any formal role in the conflict, saying that the troops  involved in the fighting are from the enclave itself.  tass said the karabakh forces decided on friday to suspend their offensive along the entire armenian-azerbaijani front.  ""the karabakh authorities are reportedly ready to give independent inspectors a chance to see for themselves on the spot that the (enclave's) leadership is striving to achieve a ceasefire,"" the agency said.  armenian president levon ter-petrosyan called for a two-stage ceasefire in karabakh when he arrived in the belarus capital minsk on friday for a summit of commonwealth leaders.  ""the first stage of the settlement should involve a ceasefire and securing the protection of the karabakh population,"" tass quoted him as saying.       at least 10 ceasefires have been brokered in the conflict but all have collapsed.  ""the second stage should involve discussing and finding a solution to the legal issues: that is, a clarification of the status of nagorno-karabakh,"" he said. the republic declared full independence last year but the move has not  been recognised by any other country.  armenia insists that a separate karabakh delegation should take part in future peace talks, something azerbaijan rejects.  local news agencies in baku said on friday that interior minister iskender gamidov, a fiery nationalist and hardliner in the territorial dispute with armenia, had resigned.  turan news agency said he quit on thursday and had cleared his office. khabar-servis agency said he would be replaced by the military commandant of baku, police major-general abdullah allakhverdiyev. there was no official confirmation.",17,talk.politics.mideast

"ten years ago, the number of europeans in the nhl was roughly a quarter of what it is now. going into the 1992/93 season, the numbers of euros on nhl teams have escalated to the following stats:  canadians: 400 americans: 100 europeans: 100     please note that these numbers are rounded off, and taken from the top 25 players on each of the 24 teams. my source is the vancouver sun.     here's the point: there are far too many europeans in the nhl. i am sick of watching a game between an american and a canadian team (let's say, the red wings and the canucks) and seeing names like ""bure"" ""konstantinov"" and ""borshevshky"". is this north america or isn't it? toronto, detriot, quebec, and edmonton are particularly annoying, but the numbers of euros on other teams is getting worse as well.       i live in vancouver and if i hear one more word about ""pavel bure, the russian rocket"" i will completely throw up. as it is now, every time i see the canucks play i keep hoping someone will cross-check bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher. (by the way, i'm not a canucks fan to begin with ;-).       okay, the stretcher remark was a little carried away. but the point is that i resent nhl owners drafting all these europeans instead of canadians (and some americans). it denies young canadians the opportunity to play in their north american league and instead gives it to europeans, who aren't even better hockey players. it's all hype. this ""european mystique"" is sickening, but until nhl owners get over it, canadian and american players will continue to have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league.      with the numbers of euros in the nhl escalating, the problem is clearly only getting worse.      i'm all for the creation of a european hockey league, and let the bures and selannes of the world play on their own continent.      i just don't want them on mine.       --  richard j. rauser        ""you have no idea what you're doing."" rauser@sfu.ca            ""oh, don't worry about that. we're professional wni                          outlaws - we do this for a living.""",10,rec.sport.hockey

"rapture - october 28, 1992  		what to do in case you miss the rapture  i. stay calm and do not panic  	your natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to panic.  but to do so is absolutely useless now.  if you had wanted to get right with god before the rapture, you could have, but you chose to wait.  now your  only chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the  tribulation.  ""but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be  saved."" - matthew 24:13  ii. realize you are now living during the great tribulation  	the great tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of the rapture until christ's second coming.  also know as ""the time of jacob's (israel's) trouble"" (jere 30:7) and ""daniel's seventieth week"" (dan 9), this  period will be unparalleled in trouble and horror.  iii. gather as many bibles as you can and hide them  	soon after the antichrist becomes the leader of the european community  (the revived roman empire), bibles will be confiscated and owning a bible will be tantamount to treason.  the bible, however, will be your most valuable  possession during the tribulation.  iv. read the bible like you have never read it before in your life  	since all of your bibles may be confiscated, even if you are careful, it is imperative that you read the word until you memorize whole passages and can quote them.  it is especially important to read daniel, luke 21, matthew 24,  revelation, and amos, for these books describe the events you can expect to unfold before you.    v. pray like you have never prayed before in your life  	pray until the power of god comes strongly upon you - pray and pray  and pray.  only by reading the word and praying will you gain the spiritual  strength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the sake of christ.    vi. do not take the mark at any cost - even in fit means you and your loved ones die as martyrs  	after the antichrist becomes the leader of the european community, he will institute a world economic system, designed so that you cannot buy, sell, or eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name.  money will be useless.  ""and he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and  slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast,  or the number of his name.  here is wisdom.  let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: his number is 666"" - revelation 13:16-18.   	the antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of  humanity.  think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed in the past, such as the holocaust. [or maybe the crusades? -m] you cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the antichrist's rule; it will be much worse than anything in history (matt 24:21) ""...i saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of god and for the testimony which they held.  and a white robe was given to each of  them: and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer,  until both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren, who would be killed as they were, was completed."" revelation 6:9, 11. 	his targets will be jews and christians who do not worship his image or take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ ""...and i saw the souls of  those who had been beheaded for their witness to jesus and for the word of  god, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on the hands."" - revelation 20:4.  he will use every form of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce christ.  nor will he hesitate to use your loved ones against you, even your children,  torturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take the mark.   	if you take the mark or worship the antichrist or his image, however, you will be consigned to the second death, which is the lake of fire. [sung about so eloquently by johnny cash...-m] you cannot be redeemed.  it is better to endure torture for a short while and gain eternal life then [sic] to endure eternal torment in the ring^h^h^h^h lake of fire.  ""...if anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives his  mark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink the wine of the wrath of god, which is poured out full strength into the cup of his  indignation.  an [sic] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the  presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the lamb."" -revelation  14:9-10   [and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders; special hats given to the first 5,000 at the stadium --m]   vii. set a plan in motion for survival  	although you may not be able to hide from the antichrist's government until the end of the tribulation, all of the time you gain in hiding is  important for your spiritual growth and strengthening, since only those who are extremely strong in christ can suffer and die for his sake. 	the first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or mountainous area, for the antichrist's control will come last to the least populated areas.  take a good radio or tv with you so that you can stay  attuned to events and discern the time schedule of the tribulation. [""as you can see on the weather map, heavy currents of tribulation will sweep into our area by daybreak.  expect delays on i-95 outbound, and perhaps school closings"" --m]  store water and food, because you will not be able to purchase anything without the mark.  water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste from nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood. [get a good water filter. --m] bring different types of clothing for all seasons, as well as flashlights, batteries, generators, and first aid supplies.  in short, learn how to  survive and live off the land as the pioneers did.  viii. trust no one 	 	there will be secret agents everywhere, spying for the antichrist's government.  be on the lookout. [perot supporters take note --m]  ix. watch for the antichrist  	it is important to realize who the antichrist is and what he is up to, for he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will bring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it.  we can infer from daniel  11 certain characteristics of this man.  popular during the first three and a half years of the tribulation, he will dominate the airwaves.  he will be  physically appealing, highly intelligent, with christ-like charisma and  personality.  an international politician, military tactician and economic expert, his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the jews, which he will break after three and a half years.  he will have such supernatural  power that a mortal wound to his head will be healed.  even the very elect will be deceived.  if you do not pray and read the bible, you too will be deceived. [dominate the airwaves?  perhaps howard stern or rush limbaugh...-m] 	the antichrist will have a companion, the false prohphet [sic], who will make an image in the likeness of the antichrist and cause it to speak.   all who refuse to worhsip [sic] the image will be killed.  the final three and a half years will be absolutely insane, with demonized spirits everywhere.  x. do not give up hope!  	the seven years of tribulation will end with the triumphant return of christ.  the antichrist will be defeated.  be steadfast and endure, and you  will be rewarded greatly in heaven.   	start reading the bible and praying fervently now.  the salvation of  your sould depends upon it.  determine that, come what may, you will not take the mark or worship the antichrist.  you still have a chance to be saved or remain saved, but this time you will have to be ""faithful unto death.""  	may god find you ready in the hour of his glorious return!  ****************************************************************************** mike cluff				*  ""christianity is stupid. v22964qs@ubvms or mike%luick@ubvms	*   give up."" -negativland ub language perception laboratory	*   ******************************************************************************   /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\   bob beauchaine bobbe@vice.ico.tek.com   they said that queens could stay, they blew the bronx away, and sank manhattan out at sea.",0,alt.atheism

"the following program is a very quick hack i created a few months ago to determine whether a sun sparcstation ipc could perform real-time, full-duplex encrypted audio with resulting data rates sustainable by today's modems.  this test program reads linearly-encoded audio from the audio device, compresses it with gsm 06.10 (compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples recorded at 8khz into 260 bits resulting in a 50 hz frame rate), encrypts it with des, then reverses the process and sends the reconstructed audio back to the audio device.  the compressed, encrypted audio stream is 13 kbits/s (!).  my sparcstation ipc (not exactly a very fast machine these days, certainly slower than an elc) would just barely sustain this activity (audio underruns would occcur but the speech was very intelligible).  i ran it as a real-time process to get the best results.  remember, though, that this program is a quick hack and the performance can certainly be improved.  the audio compression routines can be ftp'd from tub.cs.tu-berlin.de, i believe (look for gsm or toast).  i used eric young's des implementation but i no longer know where i got it from.  cheers!greg  <--------------------------- cut here -----------------------------> /*  * test program to see how much cpu it takes for secure digital audio.  * written by g. onufer (greg@cheers.bungi.com).  *  * written on a sun ipc running solaris 2.2 with a sun isdn s-bus card  * and a speakerbox.  */ #include <stdlib.h> #include <unistd.h> #include <fcntl.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <sys/types.h> #include <sys/audioio.h> #include <stropts.h>  #include <gsm.h> #include <des.h>  boolean_t svs_audio_init(int fd, audio_info_t *prev_info) { 	audio_info_t info;  	if (prev_info != null) { 		if (ioctl(fd, audio_getinfo, prev_info) < 0) { 			perror(""audio_getinfo""); 			return (b_false); 		} 	}  	audio_initinfo(&info);  	info.record.pause = b_true; 	info.play.pause = b_true;  	info.play.sample_rate = 8000; 	info.play.encoding = audio_encoding_linear; 	info.play.channels = 1; 	info.play.precision = 16; 	info.record.sample_rate = 8000; 	info.record.encoding = audio_encoding_linear; 	info.record.channels = 1; 	info.record.precision = 16;  	info.record.buffer_size = 320 * 4;  	if (ioctl(fd, audio_setinfo, &info) < 0) { 		perror(""audio_setinfo""); 		return (b_false); 	}  	if (ioctl(fd, i_flush, flushrw) < 0) { 		perror(""i_flush""); 		return (b_false); 	}  	 	audio_initinfo(&info);  	info.record.pause = b_false; 	info.play.pause = b_false;  	if (ioctl(fd, audio_setinfo, &info) < 0) { 		perror(""audio_setinfo""); 		return (b_false); 	}  	return (b_true); }   boolean_t svs_in(int ifd, gsm handle, gsm_byte *buf) { 	gsm_signal sample[160];  	if (read(ifd, sample, sizeof (sample)) != sizeof (sample)) { 		fprintf(stderr, ""svs_in: short read\n""); 		return (b_false); 	}  	gsm_encode(handle, sample, buf);  	return (b_true); }   boolean_t svs_out(int ofd, gsm handle, gsm_byte *buf) { 	gsm_signal sample[160];  	if (gsm_decode(handle, buf, sample) < 0) { 		fprintf(stderr, ""svs_out: gsm_decode failed\n""); 		return (b_false); 	}  	if (write(ofd, sample, sizeof (sample)) != sizeof (sample)) { 		fprintf(stderr, ""svs_out: short write\n""); 		return (b_false); 	}  	return (b_true); }   main() { 	gsm handle; 	gsm_frame frame; 	int audiofd; 	int option; 	des_cblock key, ivec_in, ivec_out; 	des_key_schedule ks_in, ks_out; 	des_cblock cbuf_in[4], cbuf_out[4], cbuf_buf[4];  	audiofd = open(""/dev/audio"", o_rdwr); 	if (audiofd < 0) { 		perror(""open""); 		exit(4); 	}  	/* 	 * initialize gsm compression code 	 */ 	if ((handle = gsm_create()) == null) { 		fprintf(stderr, ""svs: gsm_create failed\n""); 		exit(4); 	}  	option = b_true; 	if (gsm_option(handle, gsm_opt_fast, &option) < 0) { 		fprintf(stderr, ""svs: gsm_option (fast) failed\n""); 		exit(4); 	}  	/* 	 * initialize des code 	 */ 	des_random_key(&key);  	if (des_set_key(&key, ks_in) < 0) { 		fprintf(stderr, ""svs: des_set_key failed\n""); 		exit(4); 	} 	if (des_set_key(&key, ks_out) < 0) { 		fprintf(stderr, ""svs: des_set_key failed\n""); 		exit(4); 	} 	memset(ivec_in, 0, sizeof (ivec_in)); 	memset(ivec_out, 0, sizeof (ivec_out));  	/* 	 * open audio device and configure it 	 */ 	if (!svs_audio_init(audiofd, null)) 		exit(3);  	for (;;) { 		/* 		 * get 160 samples (16-bit linear 8000hz) and 		 * convert to a 33 byte frame 		 */ 		if (!svs_in(audiofd, handle, frame)) 			exit(1);  		/* 		 * encrypt/decrypt block 		 */ 		des_cbc_encrypt(frame, cbuf_out, (long)32, ks_in, ivec_in, 		    des_encrypt); 		des_cbc_encrypt(cbuf_out, cbuf_buf, (long)32, ks_out, ivec_out, 		    des_decrypt);  		memmove(frame, cbuf_buf, 32);  #if 0 		if (memcmp(cbuf_in, cbuf_buf, 32) != 0) { 			fprintf(stderr, ""svs: memcmp failed\n""); 			exit(4); 		} #endif  		/* 		 * take 33 byte frame and convert to 160 samples 		 * and play 		 */ 		if (!svs_out(audiofd, handle, frame)) 			exit(2); 	}",11,sci.crypt

"los angeles times, saturday, may 8, 1993.  page a11.  figure in adl spy case arrested at s.f. airport      espionage: former police officer is taken into custody upon     arriving from philippines, where he had fled after fbi     interrogation.  by jenifer warren, times staff writer  san francisco -- a former san francisco police officer who fled to the philippines amid accusations that he funneled confidential law enforcement information to an investigator for the anti-defamation league was arrested at the airport here on 11 felony charges, police said friday.  thomas j. gerard who abruptly left the united states in october after the fbi questioned him about his activities, was apprehended thursday night after a source in the philippines told investigators that gerard was returning home.  gerard, 50, was booked into san francisco county jail early friday morning on eight counts of theft of government documents and one count each of computer theft, burglary and conspiracy.  if convicted on all charges, gerard could face 16 years in prison and $40,000 in fines.  bail was initially set at $250,000 after police argued that he was a flight risk, but it was later reduced to $20,000.  a friend of gerard was trying to post bail late friday afternoon, a sheriff's spokeswoman said.  gerard returned to the united because he missed his wife and child, with whom he lived on a houseboat in sausalito, and ""wanted to have his day in court,"" said police capt. john willett, his former boss and one of two arresting officers.  gerard, an undercover agent for the central intelligence agency from 1982 to 1985, also feared that the cia was out to kill him, willett said.  in an interview with the times last month, gerard threatened to disclose illegal cia support of death squads in central america if he was indicted and tried on the san francisco spying charges.  gerard is a central figure in a scandal over an intelligence network operated by the anti-defamation league, a prominent jewish civil rights organization.  investigators allege that gerard illegally gave criminal histories to roy bullock, a san francisco art dealer who said he has been an undercover adl intelligence operative for 40 years.  investigators said they found confidential police files in bullock's home computer -- which contained entries on 10,000 people and 950 groups -- and in boxes in his apartment.  files have also been seized under search warrants from adl offices in san francisco and los angeles but authorities have not disclosed their contents.  gerard could not be reached for comment friday, and his attorney, james lassart, did not return telephone calls seeking comment.  in the interview with the times last month, however, gerard acknowledged snooping and sharing some information with bullock, but denied any criminal wrongdoing.  bullock and gerard also are under investigation for selling intelligence to south africa.  adl officials have described bullock as a $550-a-week independent contractor and have vigorously denied knowledge of any illegal activity.  on friday, adl lawyer jerrold ladar said gerard's arrest ""has nothing to do with adl.  other than that, we have no comment on the case.""  arab-american groups -- which were a main target of the spying, according to police -- applauded the arrest and pressed authorities to pursue the investigation.  ""we urge investigators to carry this case forward and to publicly disclose the full extent of adl and law enforcement involvement,"" said james zogby, head of the arab american institute in washington.  police, meanwhile, characterized gerard's arrest -- the first in the inquiry into the spying scandal -- as an unexpected breakthrough.  a former police colleague of gerard, inspector fred mollat, visited gerard several weeks ago and urged him to return home.  ""i knew he wouldn't want to live on an island on the lam forever, but we didn't think it would happen this quickly,"" capt. willett said.  ""this development really speeds up our timetable on the case.""  during his 25-year career on the police force, gerard was a highly regarded officer known for his work in the department's intelligence division.  his last assignment was on the gang task force.  after fbi agents questioned gerard last fall, he took early retirement and fled to the remote jungle island of palawan, 300 miles south of manila.  gerard was arrested at 8:40 p.m. as he stepped from his philippines airlines flight. he was traveling alone and looked tanned but haggard after his six-month hiatus, police said.  ""he was surprised when he saw us standing there, and got a shocked look on his face,"" willett said.  ""then he said, 'hello, i'm back.'""",17,talk.politics.mideast

(p 272).   6] most of the copies of the text of acts that we have (including the ones in vaticanus and siniaticus) adher pretty closely to the shorter (or alexandrian) version.  the longer version to which you refer is usually called the ""western"" version and its main witness is the codex bezae (althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources).  7] as far as size, the difference is that in clark's edition (mentioned above) the book of acts contains 19,983 words whereas the text edited by westcott and hort (a typical alexandrian text) contains 18,401 words; i.e. a difference of about 8-1/2%.  8] to answer the obvious questions, no, there are no major revelations in the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text.  the main difference seems to ""expansion"" of detail in the western text (or, if you prefer ""contractions"" in the alexandrian).  the western text seems to be given to more detail.  there are some interesting specific cases, but this probably not the place to go into it in detail.  9] the discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the more authentic has been hot and heavy.  if there is anything approaching a modern consensus it is (i) that neither text represents purely the ""authentic"" version, (ii) each variant reading has to be examined on its own merits however, (iii) the variant in the alexandrian text is the ""better"" more often than not.",15,soc.religion.christian

"sixteen days i had put off test driving the honda st1100.  finally, the 17th was a saturday without much rain.  in fact it cleared up,  became warm and sunny, and the wind died.  about three weeks ago, i took a long cool ride on the hawk down to cycles! 128 for a test ride. they had sold, and delivered, the demo st1100 about fifteen hours before i arrived.  and the demo vfr was bike-locked in the showroom -- surrounded by 150 other bikes, and not likely to move soon.  today was different.  there were even more bikes.  50 used dirt bikes, 50 used street bikes, 35 cars, and a big tent full of outlandishly fat touring bikes with trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot. some sort of fat bike convention.  shelly and dave were running one msf course each, at the same time.  one in the classroom and one on the back lot.  plus, there was the usuall free cookout food that cycles! gives away every weekend in the summer.  hmmm, it seemed like a big moto party.  after about ten minutes of looking for rob c, cheif of sales slime, and another 5 minutes reading and signing a long disclosure/libility/ pray-to-god form i helped jt push the st out into the mess in the parking lot.  we went over the the controls, i put the tank bag from  the hawk into the right saddlebag, and my wife put everything else into the left saddlebag.  ( thats nice.... )  having helped push the  st out to the lot, i thought it best to have jt move it to the edge of the road, away from the 100+ bikes and 100+ people.  he rode it like a bicycle!  'it cant be that heavy' i thought.  well i was wrong.  as i sat on the st, both feet down, all i could  think was ""big"".  then i put one foot up.  ""heavy"" came to mind very quickly.  with cindy on the back -- was she on the back?  hard to  tell with seat three times as large as a hawk seat -- the bike seemed nearly out of control just idling on the side of the road.  by 3000 rpm in second gear, all the weight seemed to dissappear.  even on bike with 4.1 miles on the odometer, slippery new tires, and pads that  did not yet bite the disks, things seems smooth and sure.  cycles! is on a section of 128 that few folks ever ride.  about 30 miles north of the computer concentration, about five miles north of where i95 splits away, 128 is a lighly travelled, two lane limited access highway.  it goes through heavily forested sections of hamilton,  manchester-by-the-sea and newbury on its way to gloucester. on its way there, it meets 133, a road that winds from the sea about 30 miles inland to andover.  on its way it goes through many thoroughly new england spots.  perfect, if slow, sport touring sections.  cindy has no difficulty with speed.  3rd gear, 4th gear, purring along in top gear.  this thing has less low rpm grunt that my hawk.  lane  changes were a new experience.  a big heft is required to move this  thing.  responds well though.   no wallowing or complaint.  behind the fairing it was fairly quiet, but the helmet buffeting was non-trivial.  top gear car passing at 85mph was nearly effortless. smooth, smooth, smooth.   not sure what the v4 sound reminds me of, but it is pleasant.  if only the bars were not transmitting an endless buzz.  the jump on to 133 caused me to be less than impressed with the brakes.  its a down hill, reversing camber, twice-reversing radius, decreasing radius turn.  a real squeeze is needed on the front binder.   the section of 133 we were on was tight, but too urban.  the st works ok in this section, but it shows its weight.  we went by the clam shack oft featured in ""spencer for hire"" -- a place where you could really  find ""spencer"", his house was about 15 miles down 133.  after putting through traffic for a while, we turned and went back to 128.  about half way through the onramp, i yanked cindy's wrist, our singal for ""hold on tight"".  head check left,  time to find redline.  second gear gives a good shove.  third too.  fourth sees dod speed with a  short shift into top.  on the way to 133 we saw no cops and very light traffic.  did not cross into dod zone because the bike was too new. well, now it had 25 miles on it, so it was ok.  tried some high effort lane changes, some wide sweeping turns.  time to wick it up?  i went  until the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat.  and stayed there.  when i was comfortable with the wind and the steering,  i looked down to find an indicated 135mph.  not bad for 2-up touring.  beverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit.  at the ""get off in a mile"" sign, i rolled off the throttle and coasted.  i wanted to re-adjust to the coming slowness.  it was a good idea:  there were several manhole-sized patches of sand on the exit ramp.  back to the  slow and heavy behavior.  cycles! is about a mile from 128.  i could  see even more cars stacked up outside right when i got off.  i managed to thread the st through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad out front.  heavy.  it took way too much effort for cindy and i to put the thing on the center stand.  i am sure that if i used the side stand the st would have been on its side within a minute.   my demo opinion?  heavy.  put it on a diet.  smooth, comfortable, hardly notices the dod speed.   i'd buy on for about $3000 less than  list, just like it is.  too much $ for the bike as it is.",8,rec.motorcycles

"the atf agent interviewed on ""street stories"" reported that the raid was ill planned, and went ahead even when they (the bd's) knew the atf was  coming. why?  i believe this raid was ill planned because they only had 2 days to plan it, and it was continued when failure was obvious because it had a bit part in the much larger political agenda of president clinton. i would even  suggest that the loss of 4 atf agents is inconsequential in this the context of his political agenda. it might even be beneficial to his agenda,  as it helps point up just how evil these assualt weapons are. further proof might be that the atf denied their agents (street stories report) requests for sufficient fire power.   important dates:  feb 25th - nj assembly votes to overturn assault weapon ban. feb 28th - compound in waco attacked.	     on feb. 25th the new jersey assembly voted to overturn the assault weapon ban in that state. it looked like it might be a tight vote, but the senate in n.j. was going to vote to overturn the ban. it would not sit well to have an eastern state overturn an assault weapon ban, given clintons stated agenda on gun control. i suspect clinton gave the order to get someone or some group with assualt weapons and have the press present (they were initially at the incident in waco) to record the event for the tv audience. the agent  on ""street stories"" reported that a supervisor was urging them all to ""get  ready fast"", as ""they know we are coming"". i believe this attack continued,  even tho the probablility of failure was high,  because it came from the top  down. after the n.j. assembly vote, the atf had a limited amount of time to come up with something, and the wackos in waco fit the bill nicely.",16,talk.politics.guns

"archive-name: rec-autos/part1  [most recent changes, 15 march 1993: addition of alt.autos.karting -- rpw]                 === welcome to rec.autos.* ===  this article is sent out automatically each month, and contains a general description of the purpose of each of the automotive newsgroups, and some suggested guidelines for discussions.  the keywords `monthly posting' will always appear to make killing this article easy for users of newsreaders with kill facilities.  this article is posted to all autos groups, but followups are directed only to rec.autos.  if you don't understand what this means, ask your system administrator for help, or at least for copies of the newuser documentation.  failing that, please subscribe to the newsgroup news.announce.newusers and read the documentation provided there.  introduction to the rec.autos newsgroup hierarchy:  rec.autos.tech  is intended for technical discussions of automobiles, their design, construction, diagnosis, and service.  other discussions are largely inappropriate, especially for sale ads.  rec.autos.sport  is intended for discussion of legal, organized competition involving automobiles.  technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply to competition vehicles.  discussion from either of two viewpoints, spectator and participant, is encouraged.  arguments about sports cars are largely inappropriate, as are most other discussions.  for sale ads are inappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles and/or equipment. discussions of illegal events are marginal; one should probably avoid advocating breaking the law.  (remember, the fbi reads usenet!)  rec.autos.driving  is intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles. also, if you must discuss 55 vs. 65, or radar detectors, or <insert your pet driving peeve> boneheads, do it here.  rec.autos.vw  is intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership of automobiles manufactured by volkswagen (this includes vws, audis, seats, etc.)  it was created on the grounds that the info-vw mailing list was very successful.  it should not be presumed from the existence of this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many different marques; groups specific to individual marques should only be created on demonstration of sufficient interest, via some avenue such as a mailing list.  rec.audio.car  is not properly part of the rec.autos.* hierarchy.  it is, however, the correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment, and so is mentioned here.  rec.autos.antique  is intended for the discussion of older cars (usually more than 25 years old, although this is not a hard-and-fast rule.)  alt.hotrod  is not part of the hierarchy, but also of potential interest to the rec.autos reader.  it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing list, and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing performance vehicles.  alt.autos.rod-n-custom  also not part of the `official' hierarchy; devoted to that peculiar american hobby of customizing older cars.  alt.autos.karting  for the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby, karting.  rec.autos  is intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics.   crossposting:  crossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on the newsgroups: line in the article header; such articles will appear in all of the newsgroups listed.  crossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on usenet.  you should only post to a group because you feel an article is appropriate; you should never crosspost just to reach a particular audience.  this distinction is subtle, but important.  radar detector articles, for example, are more-or-less appropriate in rec.autos.  they are almost never appropriate in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio, and the fact that you might want to reach the audience in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio is not adequate justification for posting to either group.  crossposting between any or all of the rec.autos.* groups is usually inappropriate; if you find yourself doing so, consider whether or not it is truly advisable, before sending your article.  consider setting followup-to: to point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost.  crossposting between rec.autos.* and misc.consumers is chancy at best; in particular flame wars over the speed limit in the us and/or the use of radar detectors should never be crossposted between any of these groups.  most readers of sci.electronics and rec.radio.* couldn't care less about the police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in rec.autos.  it is an excellent idea to check the newsgroups: and followup-to:  lines of articles before posting a followup.  in particular, be wary of posting to misc.test, rec.arts.startrek.*, or talk.bizarre, or any combination of these three.  the life you save may be your own.  distribution:  there is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to (partially) control where the article goes; it is called the distribution field.  it may be very useful for many reasons; it should also serve as a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system.  the distribution of rec.autos.* is fairly extensive.  as of this writing,  the automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of europe, australia, new zealand, and some locations in japan.  with this in mind, i offer the following hints about use of the distribution: field in your article headers, and on article content.  1) please take care not to send for-sale ads about clapped out ford mavericks in new jersey to france or california; i doubt that anyone in either place will care, except for my girlfriend, who for some strange reason likes mavericks (but only 4-door mavericks, at that.)  2) when posting technical questions, please include the market for which your car was manufactured.  for example, there are a number of differences between a european-market ford escort and a us-market escort.  likewise, all 1750cc and early 2000cc alfa romeos reached the us with spica fuel injection; european market cars usually got carbs (often webers).  these differences can be important to your readers; make your situation clear. failure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant spread of misinformation.  3) be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting; in the us we get a mix of metric and english system values, whereas europe is almost entirely on the metric system.  a future edition of this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly-used abbreviations that may not be known in some places that rec.autos reaches; this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it.  4) use the distribution: field to limit where your article goes, when possible.  within north america, the values na (north america), can (canada), and usa may be used.  in addition, the two-letter state abbreviations of the us are supported in some cases; e.g. if i wanted to send an article only to new york and new jersey, i could put ""ny,nj"" in a distribution field.  note that multiple, comma-separated values are legal.  these distribution fields vary widely, however, so you should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely to be supported in your area.  the dangers of overgeneralization:  to amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article: be wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars, tires, etc.  what is true for a 1973 buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a 1976 honda with a 1200cc engine.  headlight laws in sweden are decidedly different from those in idaho.  the need for adequate specification:  when you ask a question, please give a reasonable amount of information; e.g., if you have a question about your honda, please specify year, model, engine size, etc.  otherwise, most answers to your question may be quite useless.   concerning lemons:  at one time or another, every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or two; even honda admits to this.  please don't waste everyone's time by announcing to the world that your `brand x' automobile is terrible, so all `brand x' automobiles are terrible, so no one should ever buy a car from the `brand x' company.  such articles are worse than useless, because they cause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful information.   concerning flames:  as much as we might wish it, a flame-free newsgroup is something that most likely will never occur.  here are some guidelines for flames and how to deal with them (a list of flame-prone topics follows in the next section of this posting):  if you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory, don't imagine for a minute that including the words `no flames' will work.  it won't, and you'll get exactly what you deserve.  if you're going to flame, you're more likely to get away with it if you can cite a fact or maybe a well-known reference.  no one is likely to believe bald, unsupported assertions.  be careful about who you choose to insult.  consider not insulting anyone.   asking the question:  it is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like `please send email, i don't read this group'.  it is a much better idea to end the question with `please send email, if there is sufficient interest i'll summarize the results in a later posting.  i may miss posted responses to this request'.  answering the question:  if someone wants to hop up their yugo, don't tell them to get a mustang. either be silent, or give them useful advice.  if someone wants advice on defending a speeding ticket, don't tell them to obey the law next time -- it's offensive, presumes guilt which is not proven, and doesn't directly address the original question.  in general, don't post in order to see your words in print, and don't post in order to enjoy feeling smug and self-righteous.   stale and/or inflammatory topics:  certain topics are considered stale by `old timers'; while discussion of them is certainly ok, and new, factual information is welcome, ravings about them are extremely tiresome, and may get the person who posts them ignored altogether.  some topics are naturally inflammatory; it is difficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them.  some of these topics include the following:  1)  the 55mph speed limit in the us: pro and con  2)  discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of     radar detectors.  3)  discussions over which radar detector is best.  4)  discussions over what is a sports car (this is one reason why     rec.autos.sport is not a `sports car' group -- everyone would argue     about what constitutes a `sports car'.)  5)  disputes over whether or not us federal law protects the driver's     right to own and operate a radar detector  6)  `buy american' discussions  7)  `clever' bumper stickers and personalized license plates  8)  <insert nationality here> cars are terrible  9)  what kind of car did maxwell smart drive?       [when i have a complete, accurate answer it will be added to the           commonly-asked questions article which is also posted monthly.           until then, please don't waste bandwidth on this topic. -- rpw]    please direct comments and suggestions about this article to:       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com",7,rec.autos

"does it do it to all tapes?  were the two tapes that it unwound of the same type from the same batch?  the reason i ask is that i bought some generic tapes that did this and found that the tape markers were not fully punched out and had closed the little marker hole.  it was only on a few tapes of a set.  did you open up the tape cartridge and put the tape back on the reels?  if you have not yet, open it up by removing the two screws on the bottom of the tape cartridge and snap the plastic shell away from the metal base.   as you are pulling the tape through the assembly try not to touch any more  than you have to.  as you are doing it, look for a couple of little holes in  the tape.  these are the marker holes which let the tape drive know when it is  at the end of the tape.  the holes are spaced a couple of inches apart.  my best guess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the second marker?    anyhow, if the tape has the holes, then check to see if the mirror on the tape is clean.  the function of the mirror is to detect the marker holes.  the tape drive shines a light at the mirror and has a pickup in the area where the reflection would come out.  when the hole goes by, the pickup detects the  light that was allowed to pass and it knows when to stop.  if the mirror is dirty or out of alighment (unlikely since it is made into the case) you might have a problem detecting the end of the tape.  if the tape drive does it on all tapes and the tapes all look good, then either the pickup or the led of the sensor system has failed or is dirty.  if you open the drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the r/w head assembly.  if it looks clean and nothing is in its way, then the drive may need to be serviced.  it is possible that the led is burned out or the sensor is out.   if it is still in warranty, you might be able to send it back to cms for repair.   --- scott hiles whiles@relay.nswc.navy.mil",3,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

"yes, but no more than he is worth. :-).  seriously: jerome is merely (and grandly) another christian witness, to be taken for what he can tell us.  he is one in the community of saints.  you seem to wish for a greater polarization and dichotomy between catholic and protestant thought than seems to me, from a historical perspective, to be valid. to be sure, rome rejects (some significant aspects of) protestant thought just as vehemently as protestants reject (some significant aspects of) roman thought.  other than some peoplw who apparently try to embody the greatest extreme of this rejection, on either side, there is not quite so vast a gulf fixed as casual observers seem to assume.  ecumenical consultations between rome and the lutherans, as well as  those between rome and the anglican communion (to which i belong) show very nearly complete convergence on understanding the basic theological issues -- the sticking points tend to be ecclesiology and church polity. thus, for example, as you go on to say:   many of us do not regard a papal decretal as having any necessary (as opposed to political) significance.  sometimes it will, sometimes it won't.  you misread me if you think that my communion, at least, ""throws out"" the deuterocanonical books.  nor do i think you should overstress the sense in which the more reformed may do so.   i seriously suggest you rethink what you are saying here.  it verges on, and could be taken as, anti-semitic in the worst sense.  the ""unbelieving"" jews were, according to what i understand as a christian, the chosen people of god, and the recipients of his pre-incarnational revelation. i think they have some say in the matter.  the javneh meeting should not be over-interpreted.  a recent magisterial study titled _mikra_ (i don't have more citation information on hand, sorry) produced primarily from the background of christian (rather than specifically jewish) scholarship suggests strongly that the javneh meeting mostly resolved a lingering question, where in practice the canon had long been fixed on the basis of the scrolls that were kept in the temple, and thereby ""made the hands unclean"" when used.  the list of ""sacred books"" that may be drawn up from josephus and other pre-yavneh sources correspond (plus or minus one book, if i rememeber the chapter correctly) to the current jewish canon of tanakh.  all of this is not to ""throw out"" the deuterocanonicals (what, by the way, is your position about the books the greeks accept and rome does not? :-)) -- just to observe that the issue is complex and simply binary judgment does not do it justice.",15,soc.religion.christian

"gee!  maybe i've misjudged you, russell.  anyone who agrees with something  i say can't be all bad.  ;-)  seriously, i'm not sure whether i misjudged you or not, in one respect.   i still have a major problem, though, with your insistence that science  is mainly about avoiding mistakes.  and i still disagree with your  contention that nobody who doesn't use methods deemed ""scientific""  can possibly know what's true and what's not.     okay, so let's see if we agree on this: first of all, there are degrees  of certainty.  it might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully  controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the  extent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain  treatment. on the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even  if uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that a treatment is useful.  this is often the best evidence we can hope for from investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support. in this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible but to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are qualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing.  secondly, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of  evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.     i come to this dispute about what science is  not only as a mathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (and occasionally in sci.med) about nlp (neurolinguistic programming).  much of the work done to date by nlpers can be better categorized as informal exploration than as careful scientific research.  for years now i have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to just take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some of the videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  not for the purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at the nlp methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information from subjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of scientific interest.  and most especially to be aware of the *questions* nlp suggests which might be worthy of scientific investigation.  over and over again the response i get in sci.pychology is  ""if this hasn't been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical research then it can't be of any interest to us.""    to me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme ""there've got to be controlled studies"" position is an nlp technique called the fast phobia/trauma cure.  simple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world's most  important psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that  it doesn't take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell  when someone is cured of one.  the nlp phobia cure is a simple  visualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (nlpers claim that it can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence is useful in treating post-traumatic stress syndrome.)  it is essentially a variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral therapists.  a subject only needs to be taken through the technique once (or, in the case of ptsd, once for each traumatic incident).  the process doesn't need to be repeated and the subject doesn't need to practice it over again at home.  now to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure.  (especially if, as nlpers claim, the success rate is extremely high.)   take someone with a fear of heights (as i used to have).  take them up  to a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  spend 15  minutes to have them do the simple visualization.  send them back up to  the balcony and see if things have changed.  check back with them in a  few weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (more long term  follow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view  even a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  in any case,  there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  to the best  of my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed  after holding for a few weeks.)  (my own cure, incidentally, was done with a slightly different nlp technique, before i learned of the fast  phobia/trauma cure.  ten years later now, i enjoy living on the 17th floor of my building and having a large balcony.)    the folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to make this simple test.  they claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that nlp practitioners,  many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill  afford to do.  (most of them are also just plain not interested, because  the whole idea seems frivolous.  and since they're not part of the scientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain  from scientific acceptance.)   the fast phobia/trauma cure is over ten years old now and the clinical  psychology establishment is still saying ""we don't have any way of  knowing that it's effective.""    these academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate  as anyone could want, of course, but they say  ""why should i prove your  theory?""  and  ""the burden of proof is on the one making the claim.""   one academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely  unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't  been described in a scientific journal.  (it's described in a number of  books and i've posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much  detail as i'm capable of.)    actually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with  favorable results), but it's apparently not acceptable because it's a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.  to me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it.   this is the kind of thing i have in mind when i talk about ""doctrinnaire""  attitudes about science.    now maybe i have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, russell.   if so, i apologize.    -- in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.",13,sci.med

"okay, i'll bite. i should probably leave this alone, but what the heck...   but didn't he credit the actual flag design to a party member - some dentist or other? i believe he gives such credit in mein kampf.   well, i'm no expert, but all of the histories of nazi germany assert this. they make reference to several scandals that occurred long before ""the night of the long knives"". the impression that i got was that homosexuality in portions of the sa was common knowledge. also, a book (by a homosexual author whose name escapes me at the moment) called ""homosexuals in history"" asserts that roehm and heines were homosexuals, as well as others in roehm's sa circle.   well, you're the one who is in germany. if you don't believe the history books, look up the primary sources yourself. those of us outside of germany do not have access to these. you do. it seems to me that there were plenty of documented instances - several scandals, the fact that on the ""knight of the long knives"" several sa members (including heines) were found sleeping together, etc. also i believe some people were complaining about the sa's homosexual activities (seducing young boys, etc). the histories that i've  read make a very convincing case. none of this sounds like urban legend to me.    i know next to nothing about irving and nothing about funk. what precisely do you know, that would contradict all of the other history books that i have read concerning the existence of homosexual nazis? are you trying to say that  all historians are taking part in an anti-homosexual smear? what about  homosexual writers who agree with the official history? don't you think they  would have found out the truth by now if roehm and heines were not homosexuals? i would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from nazism. no one  should use any connection between the two to bash homosexuals in any case.    if you are going to challenge *all* historians on this point (not just irving), then the burden of proof is on you. track down the references. find out where the stories originate from. again, you are the one in germany, close to archival material - most people on the net are not.   eh? what is your agenda here? to prove that the nazis were heterosexuals, so that you can bash heterosexuals? does it bother you that some of the nazis might have been homosexuals? does this make all homosexuals bad if this is true? of course not. and what about bisexuals? are they half-nazis?  i don't know why it would be so difficult to believe that some nazis were homosexuals. the german officer corps before ww1, for instance, was notorious for its homosexuality. there were numerous scandals which rocked the german govt. during the late 19th and early 20th century. many of the kaiser's friends were prosecuted - the kaiser was no homosexual, but the germany army had a long tradition of tolerating homosexuality, going far back into prussian history - back to frederick the great at least, who was himself a homosexual. roehm was a  product of this prussian officer tradition, and the old german army (like the english public school system), being a well known center of homosexuality, would have been quite willing to overlook roehm's homosexuality.  in addition, some nazis complained of homosexuality in the hitler youth. the hitler youth swallowed up all pre-nazi youth groups, and some of the various  pre-war vandervogel, bund, and volkish youth groups were known to promote  homoerotic ideals and friendship, and in many cases, homosexuality itself. so  it seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual nazis,  regardless of the official nazi dogmas concerning the ""evils"" of homosexuality. why should this suprise anyone? homosexuality has always existed, in all  societies - it would be most unusual if the nazis were an exception.  no, i don't have any sources for you, as i think the only kind of proof you will accept would be citations from archival material, and i do not have access  to these. nor do i intend to reread every book on the nazis and on modern homosexuality that i have ever read - i don't have the time. nothing is stopping you, however, from chasing down those sources. until you prove otherwise, though, i will stick with the established histories.",19,talk.religion.misc

"if you agree that good works have a role somewhere, you will  generally find yourself in one of two camps:      (1) faith + works --> salvation or (2) faith --> salvation + works  either (1) works are required for salvation, or (2) faith will  inevitably result in good works.   i am also of the opinion that salvation is by faith alone, based on ephesians 2 and romans 3:21-31.  i also conclude that james 2, when  read in context, is teaching bullet (2) above. when james speaks of  justification, i would claim that he is not speaking of god declaring the believing sinner innocent in his sight (paul's use of the word).  instead he is speaking of the sinner's profession of faith being  ""justified"" or ""proven"" by the display of good works. also according  to james 2, the abscence of such works is evidence for a ""dead"" or  ""useless"" faith which fails to save.  james 2 is not a problem for the doctrine of salvation by faith if it is teaching (2).  works would have their place, not as merit toward  salvation, but as evidence of true faith.   regards,  --- dave weaver               | ""he is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to weaver@chdasic.sps.mot.com|  gain what he cannot lose."" - jim elliot (1949)  [there are of course a number of other possibilities.  the reformers believed    salvation --> faith --> works  some of us suspect that the three things are tied up together in such a way that no diagram of this form can do it justice.",15,soc.religion.christian

"[stuff about autobahn and safety of sho at speed deleted]  the mustang is a much worse case of design irresponsibility than the sho.   its hard to predicatbaly drift a stock mustang because of the suspension.   yes. when i think mustang, i think school-bus +  f16 motor. in my mind the mustang should be fitted with a speed limiter at 80-90 or so. it just isn't safe, check out your local junkyard, mustangs outnumber other cars by a proportion way in excess of sales in junkyards.  i find it astonishing the cu or somesuchlike has not jumped on the mustang for poor brakes in relation to power. ford should at least standardize on the svo rear brakes for all 5.0's.     true of northern europe, latin countries are something else.  kindof true. remember they were build by adolf in the '30's.   yes.   ""autobahn"" is the german word for freeway. other countries have different names for loose equivalents; autostrada, autoroute, motorway etc.   europe did seem on the brink of a 130kmh limit. it hasn't passed as far as i know. typical speeds in western europe are much higher than the us. law enforcement is negligible in my experience (comapred to the us) as there is no revenue enhancement motivation. the things you really notice are the higher speed differentials, and the more professional attitude to driving. you just never see two cars running parallel at 55.1 mph oblivious to all around them.   you're wrong. gti's  go this fast. just kind of noisy, not the ideal  autobahn car. a lot of times you see cars being driven with the drivers foot on the floor. how do i know? - when you're not making any ground on the identical car in front of you!   if something happens at 130-150 you're dead, but the same goes for much over 35. driving at high speed forces you to concentrate. i feel much safer driving 130+ on the autobahn than 60-80 in typical us traffic because most people seem to be awake. i've never seen any driver reading a book on an autobahn, i see it all too often in the us.  craig  it just doesn't *seem* fast after 30 minutes or so of aclimation. everybody drives that fast, no big deal.",7,rec.autos

"i hope that this comes off as a somewhat unbiased assesment of wfan and wip(i go to school in philadelphia, and i listen to both stations on a consistant basis.)  now that the fan has mike lupica on from 10 to noon, they have a person who can get the  big name guests for interviews, and not just of local importance he did have dave cheketts and fred wilpon on his show, but he  had bob costas and magic johnson on too.     now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent: morning show:   in my opinion, i think imus is much better than bruno, cataldi,  and morganti, even though i would feel different if morganti had a better crew of people to work with.  to me, wip tries to copy imus but make it all sports as a theme.  in terms of sports, imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but he interjects humor and politics into his show. 10 am to 12 noon:   i think chuck cooperstein and lupica are equal in their abilities to host a radio show, but i think chuck has the advantage over lupica in terms of dealing with the caller who is asking about who the local team is going to draft in the sixth round.  lupica and the other hosts on fan get better interview guests, but i heard the pd of wip say that they were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless it was a major story.   i would consider this even because they are two different styles of host.  12 noon to 2 pm:   at this point, i would have to give a big advantage to  jody mcdonald over len berman because lenny has only been on for a couple of weeks.  i just think jm has the ability to transcend the ""homer"" mentality of the philadelphia fan base.  this is most evident when the iggles(philadelphia  spelling) play the cowboys because jm is a huge dallas fan. where else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0 score without the egging of the hosts(re:wip morning 'guys') i do agree that jm was great on the fan weekend overnight and i miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating hosts.  i feel that jm is the best sportstalk host on  either station by a good margin.  if you are in ny and you can't get wip, jm does fill in on the weekends sometimes.  2pm to 4pm:   this is the time when jm goes up against francesa and  russo(fatso and froot loops) and i become the most divided in my loyalties.  mike and the dog are very entertaining, but they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10 to 20 minutes without talking about sports.  matd do get great guests and that is the basis for their show, so it is like the 10 to 12 debate.  another plus is the appearances by mike and chris on imus in the morning, which are often hilarious.    4 pm to 7 pm:   matd go up against fredericks and missanelli.  i like mike missanelli but i just can't stomach steve fredericks.   i know that sf came from philly originally, but when he was at the fan, he was a ny homer as much as he is a philly homer now.  i don't listen to wip much after 4 pm unless there is a game on that night, but you will see later for the  reason.  that is why i give the advantage to fan.  7 pm to midnight:   s&m are on wip until 8 and then it is the man who makes eli that calls matd all the time seem like a novice on charges of racism, g cobb.  this man is so grating on my nerves that if i listen to him for a few minutes i go nuts.(i know that is biased, but listen to his show) on fan, there is usually a game on, knicks, rangers, mets jets, or st. john's basketball.  if the game is on the west coast, then it is usually howie rose.  of course i think dead air would be better than g cobb on wip, but wip does air sixers and flyers games during the season. (if this is the sports station, why did they lose the iggles to wysp(home of howard stern in phil.)) during the summer, it is all talk on wip.   overall, i would have to give the advantage to wfan, with the exception of 10 to 12, and 2 to 4 where it is even, and 12 to 2 where wip has the advantage.                   rich",9,rec.sport.baseball

"golgotha the whole process of the fall of man  this was precisely my point.  from a theological bent, those who lived immediately after the flood, such as noah, ham, his son cush, and his son nimrod had a much stronger appreciation of divine wrath.  they also had a stronger understanding of the true god.  in fact, this immediacy was a cause of hardship for some, so much so that atlas, who is seen with heavens resting on his shoulders.  but this is not merely the physical heavens that he is lifting.  it is to put god and the strict spirituality of his law at a distance, and thus he became the ""elevator of the heavens.""  this ""god"" made men able to ""feel"" as if heaven were afar off and ""as if either the god of heaven could not see through the dark cloud, or did not regard with displeasure the breakers of his laws.""  it is interesting to see that it was that was titled ""emancipator"" or ""deliverer""  or phoroneus. it was nimrod who invaded the patriarchal system and abridged the liberties of mankind, yet was worship for having given many benefits.  he was a deliverer all right but not as we think of christ as a deliverer.  one delivered from a conscious feeling of god's wrath, the other actually performed a delivery from gods wrath and it is up to us to accept it as true.   i don't see the problem.  from the time of adam, those who looked forward to the coming ""anointed one"" and put their faith in the fact that it was god who was to do the provision, were accounted as righteous.  but up to the crucifixion, their sins were only covered, not taken away.  therefore, the dispensation of the church views the accountability of sin the same, but see it as a completed action.  rom's makes it clear that it has always been salvation via faith and nothing else.   i understand what you're trying to convey, but i don't think i'd lay hold of it because the scriptures do equate the eternality of the second death with the eternality of, say the church ruling with christ.  jn 17 tells us what eternal life is exactly, as you are correct that it is much more than non-cessation of consciousness.     it depends upon your def of ""lost.""  the elect were lost only in time as outside of time they had been chosen from the foundation of the world.  existentially we were all born ""lost"", but the ""righteous"" were ""in christ"" and therefore never *assuredly* lost.    maybe this summer i could find time to put together a paper on it.  i simply have to buy more books for myself, and these older books are very expensive.  either that or countless trips to the oriental museum.   couldn't agree with you more.  our understanding, of say eschatology, is clearly clearer than that of, say isaiah.  but that is not what i was referring to.    no, i understand it as you have said. this was my point.   ah!  this is it.  this is the big question.  however, i would say, again i think, that the best lie is one that has an appreciable amount of truth to it.  look at satan's twist of god's word when he coerced eve.  that is a very interesting study.   >the similarity in the midst of great variety of  yes, that is my point.  but it is a two edged sword. for some do not want the underlying reality to be revealed.  they were not known as ""mystery"" religions for no reason.  there was the public side of them and there was the private side, that was so protected that the initiates to an oath of death if they revealed that private side.  that is why it is so hard to bring their teachings to light. the ""mystery of iniquity"" that we find in the bible, correlates to this i think.  the primary object of the mysteries was to introduce privately, little by little, under the seal of secrecy and sanction of oath, what it would not have been safe to openly profess was the true religion.  case in point today might be the masons.  (just a note, that they too worshipped osiris in egypt, who can be traced to nimrod, the ""husband son."")   no, i disagree with you here gerry.  i know what you're alluding to in that the church, primarily the rcc, did endorse aristotelian philosophy into their worldview, but i would disagree with you that it originated in greece.  if you are a student of history, you will come to see that much of what greece came to expound to the world as their original, was just an adulteration of that which they had taken from conquered countries.  the soul is clearly mentioned and discussed at length in the egyptian religions. as was the unity of god and also the trinity of god.  see if you can find wilkinson's ""egyptians.""  he really does a number on what the greeks did to what they ""pilfered"" from the egyptians.    i'm not knocking aristotle or plato or any other greek thinker.  its just that ""there is nothing new under the sun.""",15,soc.religion.christian

"in the wake of the waco denouement, i had email discussions with people from this group.  in particular, we discussed how cults operate, why the fbi might be motivated to black out news or behave the way it did, and what kinds of problems are involved in dealing with cults and similar organizations.  i include an edited account of what i wrote.  the identity of my correspondents have (i hope) been erased.  the editing process makes the text choppy - sorry about that.  i've tried to retain the information content.  ellipses (...) indicate where text was removed.  a few of the comments in parentheses are new, intended to make it easier for outsiders to understand.  these notes are preliminary - feel free to criticize.  cheers(?), oded  ------------------------ (begin included text) -----------------------  i took a course called the madness of crowds, ...  the course included cults and briefly mentioned/analyzed jonestown.  (did some external reading too).  william adorno ... edited a series of books on the psychology of ""evil"" mass movements...  starting with the authoritarian personality, university of chicago press, 1948 ... an attempt to figure out what would motivate people to support fascism or be the bad guys in wwii, and by extension in other wars, in racial lynchings ...  i don't think the books are perfect, and the study of psychopathology has advanced ..., but you can elicit koresh types from even the first volume.  so i think they're onto something.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 		how cult psychology works... 	[i'm an amateur.  hope i'm not hopelessly naive.]  so long as koresh could ""own"" his people, he made sure they didn't believe there was any life out there for them, away from him. otherwise, he'd (koresh) be nothing.  during the siege, ex-davidians recounted how he convinced the people in the compound they survived only through his intercession with god to spare their worthless souls. absolutely classic brainwashing technique. ...  as long as they believed him, they'd ignore batf/fbi/child protective services or even the red cross asking them to come out.  after all, if they ever left him, god would catapult them straight to hell, and the combined forces of the us gummint, with all the goodwill in the world (doubtful) couldn't save them for a second.  if i believed it, i'd stay and die too, like the folks in jonestown.  for a prosaic analogy, replace a cult leader with an estranged wife (or husband), and notice how many folks show up, kill the ex and then themselves.  that's the consequence of shattered ""cultism.""  it really does happen all the time.  [by the way, the treasured ideal in such cases, without which life is meaningless, is the relationship, no matter how abusive, rather than the individual's partner.]  ...  ----------------------------------------------------------------------     [why no news, don't the feds owe the world an explanation?]  i agree that official explanations are in order.  i can also see good (?)  reasons for news blackouts.    ... that no matter what, those people would have died, because koresh made sure they believed they had no lives outside his influence. hence it would make little difference when or how the fbi acted.  he held them hostage, as his trump against going to jail, but nothing would really stop him from offing them.  even if the fbi went away!  look at history.  rep leo ryan (and some staffers) visited jonestown, at the request of constituents who had relatives there.  once jonestown was discovered, and even though they killed ryan and his entourage ... they all killed themselves, because jim jones knew he'd be busted.  internal arguments asking to spare the children, brought up by some of the women in the cult, were shouted down.  there are tapes...  the ""logic"" of saying that no matter how bad the gummint is, it wouldn't kill the kids, was shouted down as blasphemy, and the people who brought it up were threatened with ostracism by people who by their own avowal would be dead within the hour.  i suspect it's the same with the branch davidians. (there's a book on jonestown by james reston jr., titled our father who art in hell.  i don't know whether it's good - never read it.)  ... the only way to prevent such a problem would be never to investigate reports of child abuse or sexual mistreatment, or organizations buying full-auto conversion kits or shipping hand grenades via ups, on the off chance of stumbling across cults that would kill themselves. ...  so, the only way the batf/fbi could ""save"" those people, and future cults, is by ignoring such signs.  i suppose there's another way - outsmarting koresh and tricking him into letting them go, or somehow influencing ""his"" people to abandon him while he owns most of their means of communication with the world. ... a mighty tough row to hoe. ...  i suspect the fbi tried to do that with blackouts, noise and other sensory insults.  however, maybe they're not very sophisticated, or maybe the job is impossible.  it's certainly possible the guy running the show was a jerk.  ... ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	[why the fbi might want to blackout during and coverup after]      ... - if they were doing a poor job of weaning the bd's from koresh, they'd want to keep it quiet so they wouldn't be embarrassed.      ... - if they were trying to wean the bd's from koresh, they'd want to keep it quiet so he couldn't outflank them, or well-meaning boneheads from any point of view wouldn't screw it up. ...  i _hate_ playing chess when the world screams in my face, especially if at checkmate time people really die, and i could be blamed.  ...  i don't think ignoring such incidents is a workable policy, unless you deny the fbi, batf, child protective services (of whatever stripe) and the rest of the gummint should exist at all.

"wishful thinking mostly. it's more likely that the moon will never be the site of major commercial activity. as far as we know it has no materials we can't get cheaper right here on earth or from asteroids and comets, aside from the semi-mythic he3 that *might* be useful in low grade fusion reactors. exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch,  and it's position in the gravity well of earth coupled with it's heat  sink capacity could offer some military utility for ""high ground"" military weapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. if space  travel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as  mt. everest and the antarctic have become, but that's a very minor  activity in the global scope of things.  luna has an inconvienent gravity field. it's likely too low to prevent calcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. yet it's too high to do micro-g manufacturing. space based colonies and factories that can be spun to any convienent value of g look much better. luna has a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbital sites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. luna offers a source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink, and shielding. the asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and heavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravity wells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.  we don't use 2/3rds of the earth now, the seafloors, and we virtually ignore antarctica, a whole continent. that's because we don't have to deal with those conditions in order to make a buck. luna is a much more expensive place to visit, or to live and work. i think we'll use the easier places first. that pushes lunar development back at least a few centuries, if not much longer.  luna's main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio astronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy earth. or as the site of a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system for defending earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. the first is unlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument. the second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good enough, and the military would really rather see the earth safe for conventional warfare again. there's little glory in watching from a bunker as machines fight each other over continental ranges. little ultimate profit either.  gary",14,sci.space

"as a former catholic and now as a very active lutheran - it is some of the ""innovations"" of the mass which made me leave the catholic church and return to the more traditional catholic chuch - the lutherans.  i spent many years as a lector reading the passion parts as appropriate in the catholic church and i found it very meaningful.  our lutheran parish just instituted the ""tenebrae"" service for good friday and i was the lector for  a paraphrased passion which was exceptional.  i heard and learned things that i have previously overlooked in the gospels - yet those ""facts"" were always there.  as a matter of interest, the pastor and i were talking about the differences between the rc and lutheran church during holy week over breakfast easter sunday.  my wife is the member of the liturgy committee in the family (called music and worship at our church).  our pastor does have control of this committee but listens very carefully to the committee's suggestions.  it needs a strong hand to lead and guide, to keep the intent and the message clear and strong as it should be through lent and the rest of the liturgical year.  additional reason for my leaving the catholic faith - lack of any selfless spiritual guidance by priests in my parishes.  aka ""wishy-washy"".   as you may gather from my comments, i feel that it is very important, ir- regardless of denominational guidelines, to have a service/mass which promotes the true reason that we are gathered there.  i am quite comfortable in a traditional mass, with receiving holy communion on the tongue, the sacrament of penance (not reconciliation), stations of the cross, so on and so forth. the reason other types of masses and parishes exist is because these feelings are not shared by everyone.  i want more people to attend church and to find the lord, but i don't want  them attending a show.  it's not.  my church works hard to have a meaningful service during lent on wednesdays, but follow traditional lutheran book of worship guidelines.  where things are changed or omitted during lent (such as the hymn of praise) it is noted so that we are aware of the reasons that it is not there.  quite frankly, it is very hard for a non-catholic to go to a mass and ""fit in"". my dear wife never could (former methodist).  and holy week masses and vigils would intimidate the daylights out of a non-catholic.  those catholics who have beared with me this far understand what i mean.  please keep in mind why we are there - to gather together in worship.  not to worry about how something is done or not done.  if there is something wrong that you feel needs addressing, by all means talk to your priest or pastor.  i have only ever met one who wouldn't listen.  they are there to  provide spiritual guidance and to help.  use them.  my differences with the catholic church are much more fundamental - but my decision to change faiths was done with prayer, intervention, and sessions with priests and ministers.  in christ, kershner --  kershner wyatt kwyatt@ccscola.columbiasc.ncr.com",15,soc.religion.christian

"look be consistent. first you post something that seems to suggest that you see xv being an 8 bit program as some sort of error.  so i post and asy it is not a bug, it is meant to be like that.  so you post and say it is not a bug, you never said it was, i have misunderstood etc. now you are saying:   if you would make up your mind what you are claiming it would make the discussion a *lot* easier.  ----------------   eh? sorry, i don't understand what you are saying here. i am aware that english is not your native language and have tried hard to fathom your meaning, but this paragraph defeats me.   yes *as i originally said*, global changes are easily possible.  but this statement contradicts what you said earlier:    ---------------    no i don't think so actually.   you were talking about loading a 24 bit image into xv (by quantising), manipulating the colours in the colour editor, then somewhow applying these changes to the 24 bit file when you exit xv. xv lets you edit individual colours. where is this sudden jumping off the topic?   yes i am aware there is no colourmap in a 24 bit file!!   i do not understand what this statement is supposed to mean.   ??? what are you saying ???   ah! now we see thew problem! first you want to extend xv to allow editing of 8 bit previews of 24 bit images. then i point out problems with this. now you are saying there is no problem because you, personally, happen not to use those parts of the program that cause the problem!!    not sure what you are saying here. certainly one can make local changes.   yes that is one possible approach. i would find a program that took such an approach clumsy, however.   well here we agree - you have not thought it through very much. you don't seem to have a consistent point to make and contradict yourself from one post to the next. ok, we all have off days - perhaps you should step back and think this one through.    as i said in the last post, jpeg is a compression algorithm. it is a way of saving disk space by trading off quality against compression. i fail to see what the problem is. you have not proposed any workable alternatives.   speak for yourself. you are the *only* person i have met or spoken to who, having quantised a 24 bit image down to 8 bits, expects this process to somehow reverse when the file is saved; keeping all modificvations that heve been made to the 8 bit image palette.  perhaps that is why you yused the singular?   look, next time you import a 24 bit image into xv look carefully at the main control panel - it tells you how many colours have been allocated to the 8 bit image. xv makes it abundantly clear that you are not editing the original 24 bit file. you are the *only* person who claims this is confusing.   is a design error the same as a bug? ;-)  read my lips. xv is a program for viewing and modifying 8 bit images. it lets you import other images. it shows, i would say, a good deal of thought about the human interface. and everyone else seems to use it happily for the purpose it was designed for. it makes no false claims.   if you would come up with a solid, logical, well argued and lucid description of precisely how these proposed extensions would work, feel free to post them. so  far, you have not done so.   argh!! after all this, a comment like that. `very easily'. ok, go ahead and code it if it is so easy.  or alternatively, look up the terms `import' and 'non-reversible transformation'.   i think this is a bit of an exageration.  what you are actually saying is, you got into a lift (elevator, if you are in the states ;-) ) and mistakenly pressed the down button to go up. everyone else had no problem. now you are trying to sue the manufacturer...   you bet   mostly. leaving aside the language issue however, it betrays some very wooly thinking (as you yourself admit) which is the same in any language. go think some more.  -- chris lilley ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- technical author, itti computer graphics and visualisation training project computer graphics unit, manchester computing centre, oxford road,  manchester, uk.  m13 9pl                        internet: c.c.lilley@mcc.ac.uk  voice: +44 (0)61 275 6045  fax: +44 (0)61 275 6040 janet: c.c.lilley@uk.ac.mcc",1,comp.graphics

"excerpts from the clipper announcement, with some questions:    in these two sections the phrases `or other legal order' and `normally a court order' imply there is some other way or ways of doing a legal wiretap. what is/are these? how do they affect the way people who trust the system of court orders to protect them feel about this escrow system?  the second section shows the sequence of events. the law enforcer, armed with his warrant, attaches his headphones to the line with his croc-clips (remember, these are the folk who couldn't cope with digital telephony) and hears a load of modem-like tones (we are talking analogue telephony here). what next? what modulation scheme do these clipper boxes use? is it possible to record the tones for use after the keys are obtained? i thought it was quite difficult to record a modem session at some intermediate point on the line. maybe they have taken a crash course in data comms and have a unit that demodulates the tones and stores the digital stream for decryption later. this would still suffer from the same problems as trying to record the tones as the demodulator would not be at one end of the line. if calls can't be recorded for decryption later it would be quite easy to foil the system by buying lots of clipper units (these are supposed to be cheap mass market items) and using them in turn.  how tolerant is the modulation scheme to errors? these things are proposed for use by us corporations to secure their foreign offices, where phone line quality may well be poor. it seems hard enough to me to get digitised speech of any quality into something a modem can handle without having to add lots of error correction to keep the decryption in sync.   this raises an intersting question in the uk. here it is illegal to connect anything to a public telecomms network without it being approved by a body called babt. it has been stated, either here or in the uk.telecom group, that they will not approve equipment that does encryption. i don't know if this is true or not, but this would make a good test case. perhaps `friendly' countries, and the uk may still qualify, will get to fish in the escrowed key pool as well.",11,sci.crypt

"that was my point. if i play poker with monopoly money i can bet  anything i want.   this is exactly why christianity is missionary in nature, not just out of a need to irritate. 8-)    to the people who wrote the bible and to whom the bible is written, there is evidence of love, but that is a cultural bias. this is a poor answer which you needn't rebut.  i will now pull the old bait and switch.  i think you should use the bible to judge man, not god. by that i mean, if your moral intuition doesn't like what is described in the bible, realize that such things are going on now. i will avoid the semantic arguments about the cause of evil and ask what are you doing to fight it? not you specifically, but everyone, including myself. if i don't like the genocide in the bible, what about the genocide that goes on right now? to move beyond the question of a hell, realize that many people right now are suffering. if you think hell isn't fair and are willing to sacrifice everything just to deny its existence, what about how life isn't fair? right now there is a young mother with three little kids who doesn't know how she will get through the day. right now there is a sixth grader who is a junkie. right now there is an old man with no friends and no money to fix his tv. instead of why doesn't god help them ask why don't we help them. i think you are correct to challenge any christian who doesn't live his life with the compassion you seem to possess.  you want evidence of god. find someone who is making a difference, someone you admire, someone who has been through some tough times and has come out with his head up. ask the person how he does it. ask  the vietnam vet who was battle medic how he kept his mind. ask the  woman who was pregnant at 15, kept the baby and now is a successful business woman. ask the doctor who has operated on a 1-1/2 pound baby. they won't all be christians, or even what you might call religious, but there will be something in common.  god is not defined in the bible, god is defined by what is in those people's hearts. it doesn't matter if you can't give intellectual assent to any description you've heard, they're all wrong anyway. the compassion you already feel in your heart  is a step in the right direction. follow that instead. then come back and read the bible and you'll see that same thing described there.   good, i guess we only have to work on your grammar. 8-)",15,soc.religion.christian

"charlie brett's suggestion -- buy one of the disposable flash cameras, use the film, then take the thing apart -- is a good one.  note, though, that you won't get a particularly precise voltage out of such a thing, and it may be a single-point design that won't adapt well to off-nominal operation.  the things are easy to dismantle.  the key piece of information is that when you advance the film on one of them, you are winding it *into* the film cassette -- it is unwound from the cassette in the factory, when the camera is made.  so no darkroom is needed for dismantling.  it's standard film, so just take the cassette in for processing.  all the camera-store people do when you bring in one of the disposables is rip it apart, toss the film cassette into the to-be-processed bin, and throw the battery in one trashcan and the rest of the camera in another.  if you take it apart yourself, you get an aa alkaline battery (still with a fair bit of life in it) and all kinds of little bits and pieces from the camera.  i expect you could even re-load and re-use the camera if you were really determined.",12,sci.electronics

"this is something i've always found a little curious. i've never quite understood the trinity thing. on the one hand, jesus is supposed to be god incarnate. but, at the same time, he is god's son ""for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son"". first question is, if jesus was god in human form, how could he really be god's son? if the holy ghost ""planted the seed"" in mary, so to speak, then it seems that jesus' relationship to god would be the equivalent to the human father/son relationship. while a son might inherit alot of the father's  qualities, he is not the father. they are still two separite entities. to try and say that a son is the same person as the father is obviously wrong. in that case, jesus and god aren't the same. on the other hand, if their relationship isn't the same as the human father/son relationship, but jesus is actually god incarnate, then he's not really god's son and he never was. he's just god manifesting himself as jesus. at least, this is how i'm seeing it. can someone who is more knowledgeable about the trinity enlighten us?   getting back to the original question, what is the great price that jesus paid to redeem our sins? was it dying on the cross? since jesus knew that he would rise again in 3 days and then ascend back to heaven, i have a hard time seeing how this is considered paying such a great price for humanity. his earthly body may have been killed, but then, so what? he suffered a few hours of physical pain, but then, there has been many a human who has suffered a great deal more. the fact that jesus was god's only begotten son doesn't seem to me to have much meaning since god can beget as many sons as he wants to. jesus being the only one was simply a matter of choice. i suspect that these questions will be very offensive to many christians on this net. to those people, please accept my sincere apologies. it is not my intention to offend or to trivialize christ. but, i do believe these are legitimate questions and i am genuinely curious.   [note that the trinity and incarnation have to be looked at together. first, your reading of the virgin birth is an uncommon one.  (in this group, it's dangerous to say that no one believes something.)  you seem to be suggesting the jesus is god's son in a physical sense, with the holy spirit as father and mary as mother.  i consider that terrible heresy, though some people react less violently.  the virgin birth says that jesus' birth is god's responsibility.  but it doesn't imply that god's sperm was involved.  indeed one (though by no means the only) speculation is that god used joseph's genetic material.  second, jesus is in some sense doubly indirect from the father.  in a trinitarian context, the term son refers to the eternal logos, who is a part of god.  the son didn't come into existence with jesus' birth. jesus is the incarnation of the son.  so his sonness isn't specifically a result of being incarnated.  rather, it's the son who was incarnated.",15,soc.religion.christian

"ok, andrew, i'll provide some evidence. a friend of mine worked for an electronics manufacturer on with a west-coast office. they routinely sold equipment to the japanese. one day, the japanese started showing up with discount demands that were amazingly close to the cost to manufacture the products.  this company routinely sent most of the manufacturing data to the field  offices. the japanese had simply intercepted it. so my friend, the computer systems admin, came up with a solution. he started sending the data out double-block-encrypted with des.   two days after this new distribution plan was implemented, the president of the company got a visit from a pair of government agents. they told him to ""knock it off"". the president gave in, since his company did a considerable business with the federal government.  now, if the government wasn't monitoring the communications, how would they even know that the encryption system was installed? further, since encryp- tion isn't illegal, and des certainly isn't, what is the basis of the government's cease-and-desist demand?  the spooks do whatever they think is necessary, with or without the blessings of the law. i'll say ""no thanks"" to clipper, or anything else the government produces. for the moment, double or triple des is probably adequate. and when the line is idle, send random garbage, just to keep 'em busy.",11,sci.crypt

"i hate to sound flippant, having shot off my mouth badly on the net before, but i'm afraid that much of this material only adds to my feeling that ""the assumption of mary"" would be better phrased ""our assumptions _about_ mary.""  in all the time i've been reading about mary on this group, i can not recall reading much about mary that did not sound like wishful veneration with scant, if any, scriptural foundation.    i find in the new testament a very real portrait of christ's parents as compellingly human persons; to be honored and admired for their humility and submission to god's working, beyond doubt.  but the almalga- mation of theories and dogma that has accreted around them gives me an image of alien and inhuman creatures, untouched by sin or human desire.  only christ himself was so truly sanctified, and even he knew temptation, albeit without submitting to it.  i also don't see the _necessity_ of saying the holy parents were some- how sanctified beyond normal humanity: it sounds like our own inability to grasp the immensity of god's grace in being incarnated through an or- dinary human being.    i won't start yelling about how people are ""worshipping"" mary, etc., since folks have told me otherwise about that, but i do think we lose part of the wonder of god's incarnation in christ when we make his parents out to be sinless, sexless, deathless, otherworldly beings.",15,soc.religion.christian

"the following is what they feed to us..... most has been posted already, but there are a number of items not seen here yet.....  redesign activities update -- following is the weekly status on redesign, based on information provided by nasa headquarters.  the station redesign team (srt) provided a detailed status report to the advisory committee on the redesign of the space station on april 22.  the day-long meeting was held in anser facilities in crystal city, va; topics covered by the srt included a preliminary mission and goals statement for the space station; science, technology and engineering research; the assessment process; and the design approach. discussions on management options and operations concepts also were held.  the design teams then presented the three options under study:  ¥ option a - modular buildup -- pete priest presented the a option. priest said the team is working to define a station that meets cost goals and has identified three distinct phases of evolution - power station, human tended and permanent presence. the team will define the minimum capability needed to achieve each phase, the total cost of each phase and the achievable capability for budget levels. the a option uses current or simplified freedom hardware where cost effective and is considering other existing systems such as the so-called ""bus-1 spacecraft,"" the orbiter and spacelab.  the power station capability could be achieved in 3 flights with freedom photo voltaic modules providing 20 kw of power. 30-day shuttle/spacelab missions docked to the power station are assumed for this phase.  human tended capability would be provided by the addition of the u.s. common module module which adds subsystems and 9 payload racks and docking ports for esa and japanese laboratories. 60-day missions with the orbiter docked to the station are assumed for this phase. different operation/utilization modes are being studied for this phase.  ¥ option b - freedom derived -- mike griffin presented the status of option b activities. griffin detailed the evolution of the freedom-derived option, from initial research capability, to human-tended capability, to permanent human presence capability, to two fault tolerance, and finally permanent human capability. griffin also outlined proposed systems changes to the baseline program, with minor changes to the communications and tracking system, crew health care system and eclss, and a major change to the data management system.  initial research capability would be achieved with 2 flights to 28.5 degree inclination (3 flights to 51.6 degrees) and consist of an extended duration orbiter-spacelab combination docked to a truss segment with 2 photo voltaic arrays providing 18.75 kw of power.  human-tended capability would be achieved in 6 flights and add truss segments and the u.s. lab.  permanent human presence capability would be achieved in 8 flights with two orbiters providing habitation and assured crew return.  two fault tolerance, achieved in 11 flights, would build out the other section of truss with another set of pv modules, thermal control and propulsion systems.  the freedom derived configuration could achieve an international complete state with 16 flights.  three more flights, to bring up the habitat module, a third pv array and two assured crew return vehicles (acrv) would complete the permanent human capability with international stage.  griffin told the redesign advisory committee that eliminating hardware would not, by itself, meet budget guidelines for the freedom derived option.  major reductions or deferrals must occur in other areas including program management, contractor non-hardware, early utilization and operations costs, he said.  ¥ option c - singe launch core station -- chet vaughn presented option c, the single launch core station concept.  a shuttle external tank and solid rocket boosters would be used  to launch the station into orbit.  shuttle main engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launch and jettisoned after et separation.  the module, 23 feet in diameter and 92 feet long, would provide 26,000 cubic feet of pressured volume, separated into 7 ""decks"" connected by a centralized passageway.  seven berthing ports would be located at various places on the circumference of the module to place the international modules, and other elements.  this ""can"" would have two fixed photo voltaic arrays producing approximately 40 kw of power flying in a solar interial attitude.  in his closing comments to the redesign advisory committee, bryan o'connor said a design freeze would be established for the 3 options on april 26 so that detailed costing of the options can begin.  the next meeting with the redesign advisory committee will be may 3.  russian consultants arrive in u.s. -- a delegation of 16 russian space experts arrived in the u.s. on april 21 and briefings to the srt by members of the russian team began on the 22nd.  the group includes russian space agency general director y. m. koptev, and v. a. yatsenko, also of the rsa.  others on the team include representatives from the ministry of defense, the design bureau salyut, the institute of biomedical problems, the ministry of foreign affairs, npo energia and tsnijmash.  the russian team briefed the srt on environmental control and life support system, docking systems, the proton launch vehicle, mir operations and utilization, and the soyuz tm spacecraft.  the russian consultants are available to the srt to assess the capabilities of the mir space station, and the possible use of mir and other russian capabilities and systems as part of the space station redesign.  they will be available to the srt through may 5.  management and operations review continues --  work continued in the srt subgroups.  the management group under dr. walt brooks is working to develop a family of options that solve the current problems and build a foundation for the transition to development and operations.  various management options have been developed including:  ¥ lead center with the center director in the programmatic chain of command.  ¥ host center with the program manager reporting directly to an associate administrator.  ¥ skunk works/dedicated program office with a small dedicated co-located hand-picked program office.  ¥ combine space station with shuttle, with the space station becoming an element of the current program.  ¥ major tune up to current organization, with current contracts and geographical distribution maintained but streamlined.  the operations group under dr. john cox is building on the work of the operations phase assessment team lead by gene kranz of nasa-jsc, which had already begun a comprehensive review of operations and had concluded in its preliminary results that significant cost reductions are possible.  as part of its work,  the operations group has identified teams of agency experts to develop detailed evaluations of each design in the areas of assembly and operations, utilization, maintenance and logistics and testing and ground operations.  what's in the week ahead? -- the design support teams will provide a comprehensive status of their option to the station redesign team on monday and tuesday at which point the design will be ""frozen"" to begin the detailed cost assessment.   also this week, the team will begin preparing for the next round of discussions with the redesign advisory committee, to be held may 3.  dr. shea steps down --  dr. joe shea stepped down as director of the station redesign team on april 22 and bryan o'connor will take over the activities of the team.  dr. shea submitted his resignation as assistant deputy administrator for space station analysis, but will continue to serve as a special advisory to nasa administrator goldin and be available to consult with the srt. mr goldin accepted the resignation so that a request from dr. shea to reduce his workload could be accommodated.  key milestones -- the key dates for the srt as they are currently being carried on the schedule are:  april 26 design freeze on options for costing  april 27 design support team present selected options to srt  may 3 status report to redesign advisory committee  may 15 interim report by redesign advisory committee  june 7 final report to redesign advisory committee",14,sci.space

"responding to the moderator:   yes, i agree.  what i'm trying to point out is that, in matters of faith (i.e. tenets which are not logically persuasive), one may be convinced of the truth of certain things through, for instance, personal revelation.  and its certainly fine to share that revelation or those beliefs with others.  and i don't think that its arrogant, persay, to accepts matters of pure faith as truth for oneself.  where i think the conflict arises is in assuming that, where disagreements on beliefs arise, all others *must* have been given the same truth, and that god  must reveal his truth to everyone in such a way that all would  honestly agree.  i think this can lead to the conclusion that anyone  who disagrees with you are being sinful or dishonest; that they are  rejecting something they *know* to be truth because it is inconvenient  for them, or because they wish to spurn god.  i would say that this is equivalent to assuming that *all* truths one  holds are universal and absolute.  and the problem i see with this is  that it negates the individuality of humans and their relationships with god.  this does not mean there is no absolute truth; just that some areas of doctrinal disagreement may be areas where god has not established or  revealed that truth.    --  comments, criticism welcome... -ken alvin@ucsu.colorado.edu",15,soc.religion.christian

"the proper term for what mike expresses is monophysitism.  this was a heresy that was condemned in the council of chalcedon in 451 ad.  it grew up in reaction to nestorianism, which held that the son and jesus are two different people who happened to be united in the same body temporarily.  monophysitism is held by the copts of egypt and ethipoia and by the jacobites of syria and the armenian orthodox.  it believes that jesus christ was god (which is correct), that he was man (which is correct), that he was one person (which is correct), but that he had only one nature and one will and oen energy (which is heretical, the orthodox position is that he had two natures and two wills and two energies, both divine and human, though the wills were in perfect harmony).  that is what mike is trying to get across, that while jesus came in human form, mike says he did not have a human nature or a human will.  in reality, he had both, though neither made him subject to original sin. it is interesting to note that the monothelites were a reaction to this conflict and attempted to solve the problem by admitting two natures but not two wills or two energies.  it also was condemned, at a late council in constantinople i believe.  andy byler",15,soc.religion.christian

"the argument for luke's genealogy being that of mary is very weak. according to luke 3:23     and when he began his ministry, jesus himself was about     thirty years of age, being supposedly the son of joseph,    the son of eli,  aside from the fact that mary is not mentioned, there are two possible interpretations: either joseph was her father or he was her brother. clearly this is not acceptable.  a third would be that joseph, the son of eli, was her father and just happened to have the name as the man to whom she was betrothed. but that would seem to be grasping at straws. the most straightforward interpretation is that luke had no intention of tracing mary's genealogy (in which case he would have named her) but that he traces her husband's, from david's son nathan.  the matthew descendant list most definitely traces down from david's son, solomon, to joseph.  matthew 1:16 reads:     and to jacob was born joseph, the husband of mary, by whom was born    jesus, who is called christ.   there are two apparent problems.  the first is, how to reconcile the two paternal genealogies - which diverge with the sons of david, solomon and nathan.  the second is, why is any genealogy of joseph relavent at all, if joseph had nothing to do with it.  if joseph was not jesus's physical father, then the original poster is quite correct, that claims for jesus's messianic heritage are not based on truth but only on appearances, whatever jesus's divine nature was.  the second problem is easy, in my mind.  we assume that joseph was not involved in the conception of jesus in any way.  however, a holy spirit capable of working a physical conception in mary is also capable of employing the physical agency of joseph's seed in this work.  in our materialistic times we interpret viginity and its loss solely in terms of a physical act, whereas it is really a matter of purity on a much higher level as well.  the important thing is that neither mary nor joseph was conscious of any union between them (they had not ""known""each other).  thus the first gospel's dedication of half its opening chapter to the genealogy of joseph is quite relevant to jesus, the virgin birth not- withstanding.  to the first question there is an answer that creates, to begin with, more problems than it resolves.  it is that the two evangelists are relating  the births of two entirely different children of two entirely different sets of parents.  except for the names of the parents and the child, and  the birthplace in bethlehem there is no point in common between the two  stories.  matthew and luke converge in their accounts only thirty years later with the baptism of jesus in jordan.  rudolf steiner offered his explanation of how these accounts begin with two children and then converge with their accounts of the one jesus of nazareth.  he did not derive his resolution from biblical study or speculation, or from other external documents, and the discussion of ""how this could be"" might bring us beyond the limits of appropriateness for this newsgroup.  in any case, the details are described in steiner's ""the spiritual guidance of the human  being and of humanity"", ""the gospel of st. luke"", and ""the gospel of st. matthew"".   whether or not rudolf steiner's methods and explanation are accepted as valid, at least this interpretation resolves the apparent contradictions of the two genealogies while leaving the text intact.  as for the passing of one's jewishness through the mother, this was never an issue with jesus. no one ever questioned his or mary's jewishness.  the issue of the genealogies has to do with his paternal line of descent from david, the king.",15,soc.religion.christian

"rather, people kill people with guns.  the sad truth is: sometimes that is good, or at least, better than the alternative.   ok.  there are about 1400 fatal firearm accidents per year [1], and the number has been in decline since early this century [2].  most of these accidents involve rifles or shot guns, not handguns.  ...  in fact there are both guns and bullets designed specifically for that.  the idea that my ruger mark ii bull barrel (a semi-auto 0.22 caliber handgun) was designed to kill or hurt people, even for self defense, would, i'm sure, come as a surprise to its designer.  it certainly isn't why i have it.  it certainly would hurt someone if you shot them with it, and might even kill them, but it is simply wrong to say it was designed to kill people.   in fact, that is what happens most of the time.  most self defensive uses of firearms don't involve firing any shots.  most criminals would prefer not to be shot, and will go to some effort not to be, including doing what you say when you point a gun at them.  if you were called on to design a tool, that could be easily carried, to immediately stop someone attacking you, what would it be?  a handgun is about the best anyone has come up with and experience shows it does work the best.[3]   certainly, no one argues that handguns (of the type we are discussing) aren't deadly weapons.  however, it simply isn't true to say that all of them were designed to kill people.  moreover, what exactly is wrong with having deadly weapons?  there are times when it is perfectly legitimate to use deadly force, e.g. in self defense.  i consider it not just my right, but my duty to defend myself and my family, and that includes having and knowing how to use the tools to do that.

"you'll probably have to set the palette up before you try drawing in the new colours.  use the bios interrupt calls to set the r g & b values (in the range from 0-63 for most cards) for a particular palette colour (in the range from 0-255 for 256 colour modes).  then you should be able to draw pixels in those palette values and the result should be ok.  you might have to do a bit of colourmap compressing if you have more than 256 unique rgb triplets, for a 256 colour mode.",1,comp.graphics

"{sorry, harel et al, but our doctors and most hospitals are still private in canada as well as in much of western europe.}   wrong.  in better ec countries that use pure (but public) health insurance (like we use in canada) rather than self-enclosed hmo-like socialized medicine, 30% of our costs comes from private supplementary insurance and/or copayments.  france magazine's summer 1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  for 1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward. with extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  the public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance.  over 2/3rds of french have some form of extra private insurance.  so, 30% of health costs in europe are out of private funds and not gleaned from other taxes.  the gdp figures are combined public and private expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure for the u.s.  that the french had deductibles and copayments in their insurance fund is to their credit ... i am in the minority for advocating such back in canada (to make the canadian insurance look more like real health insurance -- which actually it is).  the new reform party, a breakoff of traditionalists from the conservatives with a mildly ""libertarian"" faction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that just a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the average canadian/european is more fiscally naive than their american counterparts on issues like these).  i'm one of the few people who favour copayments (forget about leftists, even our conservatives attack me for it on the canadian newsgroups) to make it look more like real insurance, 'cos the 100% insurance payment is hidden (unlike in france) and if you didn't know it, you'd believe it actually is socialized medicine (american conservatives/libertarians and canadian leftists are the only ones who seriously call it that).  canadians aren't worried about the americans, who spend 14%; we're worried about the french and germans who spend 7% to our 9% ... so the insurance is looking at things that shouldn't be paid for out of general funds like physicals for insurance policies, sick notes, electrolysis, etc.  the reason that the canadian health insurance hasn't spiralled out of control despite being open and universal is that unlike americans, there is no urge to spend all of your benefits' worth, and more if you can ... we're a different culture.   ""managed care"" relies on hmo's, which are unknown in most western nations that use only public health insurance like canada, france and germany (i'm canadian, and my german father-in-law-to-be says of hmo/nhs approaches, ""we left that behind with east germany!""). sure, hmo/nhs controls costs because you have managers strangling doctors with budget strings.  in canada, we use the public health insurance approach as in france and germany, with all private doctors and both private and public hospitals.  it is all pure insurance without hmo's.  the divisions are different, with the germans using a couple hundred interlinked ""sickness funds"" over a century old while canada divides by their provinces (who run the insurance fund and set local fees with the doctors monopoly; federal funds cover the fees disbursed.)  with such an open-ended system, it's no surprise that canada is #2 to the u.s. in costs; all-insurance is the most expensive way to go. the french and germans use the same approach but have larger populations in more compact geography to improve scales of economy.  gld",18,talk.politics.misc

"my wifes uncle was a 30+ level mason.  he let me look at some of the books (which after his death his ""brothers"" came over and took from his greiving widow before his body had even cooled).  don't tell me you don't worship osiris.  you must not be past your 20th level.  you should read wilkinson's egyptians and how he shows this egyptian religion paralleling his own british masonry.  there is a man here at this laboratory who is a 33 degree black mason.  i've talked with him, though much he likes to hide (""mystery"").  special handshakes and all.  when he first started trying to ""evangelize"" me, he told me all kinds on special this, and special that.  here is truely a ""mystery"" religion.  there is the public side with motorcyle mania and childrens hospitals and then there is the priviate side that only the highest degree mason every learns of. i haven't read it, but the literature that is offered by the silver haired apologist (can't remember his name) on tv, didn't exactly come to this same conclusion.    ""khons, the son of the great goddess-mother, seems to have been gernaerally represented as a full-grown god. the babylonian divinity was also represented very frequently in egupt in the very same wayas in the land of his nativity -i.e. as a child in his mother's arems.  this was the way in which osiris, 'the son, the husband of his mother,' was often exhibited, and what we learn of this god, equally as in the case of khonso, shows that in his original he was none other than nimrod.  it is admitted that the secret system of free masonry was originally founded on the mysteries of the egyptian isis, the goddess-mother, or wife of osiris.  but what could have led to the union of a masonic body with these mysteries, had they not had particular reference to architecture, and had the god who was worshipped in them not been celebrated for his success in perfecting the arts of fortification and building?  now, if such were the case, considering the relation in which, as we have already seen, egypt stood to babylon, who would naturally be liiked up to there as the great patron of the masonic art?  the strong presumption is, that nimrod must have been the man.  he was the first that gained faim in this way.  as the child of the babylonian goddess-mother, he was worshipped in the character of ala mahozim, 'the god of fortification.'  osiris, the child of the egyptian modonna, was equally celebrated as 'the strong chief of the buildings.'  this strong chief of the buildings was origninally worshipped in egypt with every physicall characteristic of nimrod.  i have already noticed the fact that nimrod, as the son of cush, was a negro.  now, there was a tradition in egypt, recorded by plutarch, that 'osiris was black'.......""  hislop  it was like a cold slap to my face, when my wifes uncle brought out his cerimonial dress and it was leopard skin.  i mean real leopard skin.   he told me that only the highest of degrees wore the leopard skin.  (the reason that he started telling me all this was that he had just been given a couple of months to live and my wife had led him to a saving faith in christ and he immediately repented from 'mysteries' of the lodge!)  nimr-rod from nimr, a ""leopard,"" and rada or rad ""to subdue.""  it is a universal principle in all idolatries, that the high priest wears the insignia of the god he serves.  any representation of osiris usually show the wearing of some leopard.  it is interesting that the druids of britian also show, or should i say hide, this representation.  they, however, worshipped the ""spotted cow"".  i'll stand by my statements.  masonry is of the ""mystery"" religions that all find their source in babylon, the great harlot. sorry peter,  i do not mean to be a ""cold slap to the face"" but there is to much evidence to the contrary that masonry doesn't find its origins in egypt.  of the masons i have personally talked to, all refered to egypt as their origin.  why are you now separating yourself from this which not many years ago, was freely admitted?",15,soc.religion.christian

(also note that just because someone's had 200 sex partners  doesn't mean they're promiscuous.  yes, it sounds ridiculous, but it's quite possible for someone to go through a heavily closeted phase in which they have lots of anonymous sex with strangers, and then come out, start forming real relationships, and be monogamous or nearly so...)",18,talk.politics.misc

"in the april edition of ""one small step for a space activist"", allen sherzer & tim kyger write:   ""another problem is what are called 'wraps' (or sometimes    the 'center tax'). when work for a large program like    freedom or shuttle is performed at a nasa center, the    center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts    to a slush fund. this money is used to fund work the    center manager wants to fund. this sum is estimated to    be over a third of the funds allocated. think about    that: of the $30 billion cost of freedom, fully $10    billion won't be spent on anything having anything    to do with space stations! now, maybe that $10 billion    was wisely spent (and maybe it wasn't), but the work done    with it should stand on its own merits, not distorting    the cost of other projects. congress has no idea of the    existense of these wraps; congress has never heard the    term 'center tax'. they look at the station they are    getting and the price they are paying and note that    it doesn't add up. they wonder this blissfully unaware    that a third of the money is going for something else.""  my dear friends, your mixing fact and fiction here. a couple of weeks ago, when i first read this in your posting, i talked with one of the cost experts here in space station at headquarters [if you wondering why i didn't post a response immediately, i do have a real job i'm supposed to be doing here at headquarters, & digging up old 20 khz data & looking into sherzer/kyger claims rates pretty low on the totem pole of priority. also, i spent last weekend in kansas city, at the national science teachers  association conference, extolling the virtues of ssf to 15,000 science teachers.]  first off, yes, the concept of 'center tax', or 'wrap' does exist. if i recall the numbers correctly, the total 'tax' for the ssf program for this fiscal year is around $40 million. this was computed by adding up the wp-1, wp-2, and wp-4 center 'taxes'. with the ssf budget for this fiscal year at $2.2 billion, my calculater says the tax percentage is 04/2.2 = 1.8%  over the life of the ssf program, using your figure of $30 billion for the cost of ssf, a tax at a 1.8% rate comes to $540 million. this is alot less than $10 billion, but i will concede it's still an appreciable amount of pocket change.  i should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1/3 could be close to the actual rate. the tax is only charged on funds that are spent at the center (kind of like mcdonalds at some states, where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat the food at the restaurant, but you don't if you get it take-out). for example, at wp-4, the vast bulk of the funds we receive go to the rocketdyne contract, and are *not* subject to the center tax (i don't have the numbers in front of me, but i'd guess at least 95% of the wp-4 funds go to rocketdyne). so, you could be right about a tax rate of 1/3, but it's only applied to funds spent at the center, and not to the prime contracts.  this leads to the obvious question ""what is the government doing with ssf funds that don't go to the prime contractors? (i.e. ok, wp-4 gets a slice of the $30 billion pie. a big portion of this slice goes to rocketdyne. what happens to the balance of the funds, which aren't eaten up by the center tax?)""  at wp-4, we call these funds we spend in-house supporting development funds (as they are supporting the development work done by rocketdyne). we have used these funds to setup our own testbed, to checkout the electrical power system architecture. our testbed has a real life solar array field (left over from solar cell research research a few years back), with lead-acid car batteries (to simulate the nickel-hydrogen batteries on ssf), dc switchgear, dc-dc converter units, and simulated loads. data from the testbed was used in a recent change evaluation involving concerns about the stability of the power system.  we have also used the supporting development money to purchase nickel hydrogen batteries, which are on life testing at both lewis and the crane naval facility in indiana. as a side point, 6 of the battery cells on test recently hit the four year life test milestone. 38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles (the on-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year).  as a final example, my 'home' division at lewis used the supporting development funds to purchase personal computers and work stations, for performing system analyses (like modeling of the performance of the electrical power system, availability calculations using a monte-carlo simulation, setting up a  database with information on weight of the power system elements).  finally, the money raised by the 'tax' does not all go into a 'slush fund.' at lewis, the director does control a small discretionary fund. each year, any individual at lewis can submit a proposal to the director to get money from this fund to look at pretty much anything within the lewis charter.  most of the tax, however, goes to fund the 'general' services at the center, like the library, the  central computer services division, the contractor  who removes the snow, etc. thus, it is rather difficult to determine what percentage of the ssf budget doesn't go for ssf activities. to get an accurate figure, you would have to take the annual expenditure for the library (for example), and then divide by the amount of the library funds used to support ssf (which would be hard to compute by itself - how would you figure out what percentage of the bill for aviation week for 1 year is 'billable' to ssf, would you base it on the person-hours ssf employees spend reading av-week versus the rest of the center personnel). you would then have to compare this estimate of the ssf portion of the library expense with the portion of the tax that goes to support the library. who knows, maybe ssf overpays on the tax to run the library, but we underpay for snow removal? talk about a burecratic nightmare!",14,sci.space

[please, no flames about whether or not gay people ""choose"" their lifestyle -- that's elsewhere in this newsgroup]   i'm not sure i understand this sentence -- could you explain?  [moderator points out that many/ most atheists aren't ""hostile"", they just cease believiing in xiantiy/ religion]   ouch, yes.  part of being a christian is accepting _everyone_ with an open heart -- including people of ""our own camp"" with whom we completely disagree.  by the same token, i believe that accusation and suspicion are not the best way to reach out to those not of our faith, nor is it effective to try to browbeat people into accepting our religion.  i have a different idea of mission: be what i am, a christian who is happy in her faith, and if others see that and want to know about either the happiness or the religion, i'll share what i know without pressure and let them make their own decisions.  at some point you just have to agree to disagree -- acceptance of diversity, not uniformity, is the way to sow peace....   vera noyes",15,soc.religion.christian

"note that ""scientific evidence"" in this area does not prove any conclusions. there has been evidence to suggest that a certain part of homosexual's brains are different from heterosexuals- but that proves very little.  also notice that the apostles did not have with them the ""scientific evidence"" linking certain genes with alcoholism, or stealing with certain genetic problems.  even if they did have scientific evidence, i doubt it would have stopped them from communicating the teaching from the holy  spirit that these things are sinful.  this reminds me of a conversation with a professor of mine.  he said  something very true.  christianity teaches that we should not give in to our every inclination.  most people do give in to their leanings. in christianity, we have the concept of struggling with the flesh, and bringing it into submission.  one person may have a problem with his temper, and having a murderous heart, another may have a problem with homosexuality, another may be inclined to greed.  but god offers us the opportunity to be more than conquerers.   the preying mantis bites the head off of her mate after she mates with him.  is it natural for a woman to do the same thing to her husband? the bible is concerned with human morality, and only touches on animal morality as it relates to humans.",15,soc.religion.christian

": clipper chip is a response to the fact that there is no business : or professional body in a position to establish a standard and : provide chipsets to implement it for analog or digial transmission : systems. :  : rsa might be in position to do it, if they had active cooperation of : a couple of manufacturers of cellular phones or desktop phones. ....... : is rsa independt of the gov enough to spearhead this?  i, for one, : would *gladly* pay royalties via purchasing secure phones.   hear hear! i completely agree that we need to work quickly to establish alternatives to the government's clinton clipper. as brad templeton and others have noted, once the clipper becomes ensconced in enough phones there will be enormous pressure to make it the *legal* standard, and it will become the ""market* standard as well. (there is a lot of confusion in the proposal about whether the use of clipper is mandated, about whether non-escrow alternatives will be allowed, etc.)  (there are also unclear issues about how hard, or how illegal, it will be to make ""workalikes"" which meet the standard but which generate phony or untappable keys...i'm sure the next several weeks will see these issues thrashed out in this and other groups.)  meanwhile, i'd be interested to hear rsa data security's reaction. often criticized in this group for their licensing policies (the usual complaints about mailsafe costing too much, at $125 or so, and the general issue of software patents...), we may find that *allying* ourselves with rsa is the best thing we can do. what's a mere licensing fee when our liberty may be at stake? (if everyone who wanted true security paid, say, $100 for a lifetime use of all of rsa's patents--which expire in the period 1998-2002, or so--then rsa would make tons of money and be happy, i'm sure. a small price to pay. for those to whom $100 sounds like too much, i'm sure the actual terms could be different, spread out over several years, whatever. to me, it's a small price to pay.)  strong crypto means strong privacy. escrowing keys, sending copies of keys to large databases, and splitting keys into two 40-bit pieces, all done with secret and non-analyzable protocols and algorithms, is *not* strong crypto!  whatever some of us may think about the abstract principles of patenting number theory applications, this minor issue pales in comparison with the potential dangers of the clipper proposal (note that i said ""potential""...we'll presumably learn more in the coming months).  the rsa algorithms are at least public, have been analyzed and attacked for years, and source code is available (to better ensure no deliberate weakenesses or trapdoors).  i know of a number of groups putting together voice encryption systems using off-the-shelf hardware (like soundblaster boards for the pc) and celp-type software. the new generations of pcs, using fast 486s and pentiums are fast enough to do real-time voice encryption. combined with diffie-hellman key exchange, this should provide an alternative to the clipper system.  of course, we don't really know if the administration proposes to outlaw competing systems. (it seems to me that their goal of tapping terrorists, child pornographers, and hilary bashers would be thwarted if low-cost alternatives to clipper proliferated. not to defend child pornographers or terrorists, but limiting basic freedoms to catch a few criminals is not the american way of doing things. end of soapbox mode.)  i suggest we in these groups set aside any differences we may have had with rsa (and don't look at me....i have both macpgp *and* a fully legal copy of ""mailsafe""!) and instead work with them as quickly as we can.  rsa?, jim?, are you listening?  -tim may  p.s. i reserve the right to retract these opinions if it should turn out that rsa data security was involved in the clipper proposal.",11,sci.crypt

"are we talking about me, or the majority of the people that support it? anyway, i think that ""revenge"" or ""fairness"" is why most people are in favor of the punishment.  if a murderer is going to be punished, people that think that he should ""get what he deserves.""  most people wouldn't think it would be fair for the murderer to live, while his victim died.   perhaps you think that it is petty and pathetic, but your views are in the minority.   where are we required to have compassion, forgiveness, and sympathy?  if someone wrongs me, i will take great lengths to make sure that his advantage is removed, or a similar situation is forced upon him.  if someone kills another, then we can apply the golden rule and kill this person in turn. is not our entire moral system based on such a concept?  or, are you stating that human life is sacred, somehow, and that it should never be violated?  this would sound like some sort of religious view.    once a criminal has committed a murder, his desires are irrelevant.  and, you still have not answered my question.  if you are concerned about the death penalty due to the possibility of the execution of an innocent, then why isn't this same concern shared with imprisonment.  shouldn't we, by your logic, administer as minimum as punishment as possible, to avoid violating the liberty or happiness of an innocent person?",0,alt.atheism

"the problem with ""let's assume"" reasoning is that, taken to the extreme (and you're close), you arrive at ""let's assume this is perfectly ok.""  the assumptions you make are big ones. if the system is really secure, then why does the government have to keep the algorithm secret?  there are plenty of encryption algorithms that don't depend upon nondisclosure to be secure, so why in the world use one that does?  there are reasons, of course, but i certainly can't think of any honest ones.  next, you assume we can ""trust"" the escrow houses. but the last time i checked, every single branch of government has experienced unauthorized disclosure, corruption, and even fabrication, of supposedly secure data. the govt is saying ""yeah, but now we're serious, so you can trust us.""  bullcrypt.   and finally, although you didn't state it explicitly, you implicitly assume that the warrant mechanism in this country is safe and reasonable. the case in ventura county of a man shot and killed by officers serving a deliberately fraudulant warrant tells me that the govt has a long ways to go on this score.  remember that all this is to catch the drug dealers, right?  as others have pointed out, the current proposal will, if deployed, render truly secure encryption much more expensive and inconvenient than uncle sam's brand. who will be able to afford, and be sufficiently motivated, to purchase this expensive, inconvenient higher protection?  somebody with lots of extra cash...  the following is more true than ever:    ""when [strong] encryption is outlawed, only outlaws will have [strong] encryption.""",11,sci.crypt

"my first encounter with a dog chasing after my bike was on my first poker run. a big german shepard ran out into the pack of bikes i was riding with and tried  to bite the right leg of the guy riding in front of me. he kicked the dog a  couple of times (we were all only going about 10-15mph) and just made the dog angrier and got away by applying wfo and outrunning the dog who then started after yours truly. at the time, i had open drag pipes (obnoxiously loud as hell) and as soon as the dog was about 2 feet away from the right side of my bike, i pulled in the clutch and revved the motor up to about 5000rpm and the roar of the pipes frightened the dog away (probably made the dog's ears hurt like hell) and he didn't come back for the rest of the bikers behind me either.   my second encounter was with an already deceased road-kill dog. i wasn't paying  very close attention to the pavement when the car in front of me straddled the carcass. i looked down just in time to see what i was about to run over so i  just held onto the handlebars and freaked out. both wheels went squarely over the dog's belly with a thump-thump just like running over a piece of a 4x4 lumber. the bike didn't lose any stability at all and i kept on going. after i got to my destination, i found bits of fur, meat, and blood stuck to the bottom of my motor and frame...... gross.",8,rec.motorcycles

"having read the posted long article by jpfo, i have some observations:  1.  this article does not claim that the gca of 1968 is a ""verbatim  translation"" of a nazi law.  what it says is that in another place -- the book they're talking about -- they compare the two things section by section.  the implication is that the similarities are devastating. in the next sentence, they talk about how in that book they reproduce  the german text of the nazi law, together with its translation.  not  surprisingly, a reader could easily conflate these two things into a  single idea:  that the american gca is a literal translation of the nazi law; and sure enough, that's what the whole thing has mutated into,  urban-folklore style.  2.  the article goes to great pains to establish that senator dodd had a  copy of the nazi law, either from his time on the nurnberg prosecution  team or later.  this fact is considered highly incriminating, but i don't  understand why.  the author repeats several times that he is simply unable  to imagine how anyone could come into possession of the original text; and  yet in a paragraph towards the end, he explains it perfectly:  ""if dodd got his copy of the original german text of the nazi weapons law during his time at nurnberg, it likely was part of a collection of documents, for example, issues of the reichsgesetzblatt [the german law registry].""  bingo.  exactly.    dodd had a *book*, with a series of nazi laws in it, including the one under discussion.  all of the stuff about ""why would a u.s. congressman have a copy of a nazi law?"" melts away, by the author's admission.  he then continues:  ""but if he acquired the original german text of the  nazi weapons law after his service at nurnberg, he must have done so  for a very specific reason...""  but there's absolutely no reason to  think that this is the case.  in fact, as a ""senior member of the u.s.  team that helped to prosecute nazi war criminals"", it seems to me that he would have *had* to have a copy.  all arguments about whether  the nazi weapon law is really of historical interest (as it obviously is, certainly according to the author here), or whether dodd personally prosecuted the interior minister who signed it, can be put aside as red  herrings.  3.  having established that dodd owned a copy of the original german text, the jpfo article then tries to draw sinister implications from the fact that he  asked to have it translated.  the problem is, in the context of the charge  levelled at dodd, these two things work *against* each other.  people ask  to have things translated when they *don't know what they mean*.  if dodd  took it upon himself to preserve the nazi law with idea of someday introducing  it into american law, surely by 1968 he would have know what it *meant*,  wouldn't he?     anyway, this precise charge -- the main one that i questioned in an earlier posting -- is just silly.  why would dodd need the exact translation for this purpose?  is the idea that the gun controllers, despite being presumably bent on disarming the populace with the goal of eventually destroying all civil liberties, needed a crib sheet?  didn't they have any idea how to do it on their own?     once again, the author provides a perfectly acceptable answer to his own question: ""dodd may have offered his copy of the nazi weapons law to show that the specific proposal did not resemble anything in the  nazi law.""  in fact, since the law and its translation *were* entered into the congressional record, under the heading of documents ""concerning the history of nazism and gun confiscation"", dodd's motivation isn't a  mystery:  he asked for the translation in order to put it in the cr.  4.  even this article makes it clear that the part of the nazi law that was added *by* the nazi regime is only a small part of that law.   registration of guns, for instance, was begun in 1928, and thus not a ""nazi-inspired"" idea.  the parts of the nazi law that parallel the  1968 gca include handgun control of some sort, and the identification  of certain weapons as sporting weapons.  the jpfo then goes on to list  other parts of the nazi law, forbidding ownership of weapons by jews; of course, there are no such provisions in the american gca.  nevertheless, in a rhetorical move guaranteed to muddy the waters, immediately after the  discussion of the anti-jewish parts of the law, the jpfo article continues,  ""given the parallels between the nazi weapons law and the gca'68..."" -- so  as to get maximum emotional mileage out of that aspect of the law.",16,talk.politics.guns

"the white house                      office of the press secretary ______________________________________________________________ for immediate release                             april 20, 1993       	                             remarks by the president             in question and answer session with the press                               the rose garden   1:36 p.m. edt 	      	      	     the president:  on february the 28th, four federal  agents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law  against the branch davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled  weaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk.   because the batf operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day  standoff ensued.   	      	     the federal bureau of investigation then made every  reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without  bloodshed and further loss of life.  the bureau's efforts were  ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were  dealing, david koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably  insane.        	     he engaged in numerous activities which violated both  federal law and common standards of decency.  he was, moreover,  responsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the  action against the compound in february.  given his inclination  towards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no  provocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal  agents against the compound.   	      	     this weekend i was briefed by attorney general reno on  an operation prepared by the fbi, designed to increase pressure on  koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully.   the plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even  in the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause  permanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people  in the compound to come outside and to surrender. 	      	     i was informed of the plan to end the siege.  i  discussed it with attorney general reno.  i asked the questions i  thought it was appropriate for me to ask.  i then told her to do what  she thought was right, and i take full responsibility for the  implementation of the decision.   	      	     yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy.   mr. koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal  agents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his  captives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not  survive.  he killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate  responsibility for the carnage that ensued. 	      	     now we must review the past with an eye towards the  future.  i have directed the united stated departments of justice and  treasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to  uncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been  done differently.  i have told the departments to involve independent  professional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  i  expect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required  to complete the review.  finally, i have directed the departments to  cooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can  continue to be fully accountable to the american people. 	      	     i want to express my appreciation to the attorney  general, to the justice department, and to the federal agents on the  front lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult  circumstances.   	      	     again, i want to say as i did yesterday, i am very sorry  for the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end  of this tragedy in waco.  i hope very much that others who will be  tempted to join cults and to become involved with people like david  koresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over  the last seven weeks.  and i hope very much that the difficult  situations which federal agents confronted there and which they will  be doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future  will be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what  has been learned now. 	      	     q	  mr. president, can you, first of all, tell us why,  after 51 days, you decided -- 	      	     q	  mr. president, can you describe for us what it is  that janet reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation  with -- 	      	     the president:  i can't hear you both.  if one will go  first and then the other. 	      	     q	  sorry.  can you describe what janet reno -- 	      	     q	  mr. president -- 	      	     the president:  i'll answer both your questions, but i  can't do it at once. 	      	     q	  can you describe what she told you on sunday about  the nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it? 	      	     the president:  yes.  i was told by the attorney general  that the fbi strongly felt that the time had come to take another  step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  and she  described generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted  to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause  permanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it  very difficult for people to stay inside the building.  and it was  hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.   	      	     i was further told that under no circumstances would our  people fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  they were going to  shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and  there would be no exchange of fire.  in fact, as you know, an awful  lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials.   there were no shots coming back from the government side. 	      	     i asked a number of questions.  the first question i  asked is, why now?  we have waited seven weeks; why now?  the reasons  i was given were the following: 	      	     number one, that there was a limit to how long the  federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the  quality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  they might be  needed in other parts of the country. 	      	     number two, that the people who had reviewed this had  never seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced  that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to  be made through the normal means of getting koresh and the other cult  members to come out.   	      	     number three, that the danger of their doing something  to themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with  the passage of time. 	      	     and number four, that they had reason to believe that  the children who were still inside the compound were being abused  significantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and  unsafe conditions. 	      	     so for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time.   the second question i asked the attorney general is whether they had  given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and  evaluated them against what might happen that was good.  she said  that the fbi personnel on the scene and those working with them were  convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only  increase with the passage of time. 	      	     the third question i asked was, has the military been  consulted?  as soon as the initial tragedy came to light in waco,  that's the first thing i asked to be done, because it was obvious  that this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  military  people were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some  of the problems that were presented by it.   and so i asked if the  military had been consulted.  the attorney general said that they  had, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one  minor tactical difference of opinion between the fbi and the military  -- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming  significance. 	      	     having asked those questions and gotten those answers, i  said that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she  should proceed and that i would support it.  and i stand by that  today. 	      	     q	  mr. president -- 	      	     the president:  wait.  go ahead. 	      	     q	  can you address the widespread perception -- reported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were  trying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster? 	      	     the president:  no, i'm bewildered by it.  the only  reason i made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only  reason i made no public statement yesterday is that i had nothing to  add to what was being said and i literally did not know until rather  late in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who  had been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into  custody.  it was purely and simply a question of waiting for events  to unfold.   	      	     there was -- i have -- i can't account for why people  speculated one way or the other, but i talked to the attorney general  on the day before the action took place.  i talked to her yesterday.   i called her again late last night after she appeared on the larry  king show, and i talked to her again this morning.  a president -- it  is not possible for a president to distance himself from things that  happen when the federal government is in control. 	      	     i will say this, however.  i was, frankly, surprised  would be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the  attorney general should resign because some religious fanatics  murdered themselves.  (applause.)   	      	     i regret what happened, but it is not possible in this  life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  these  people killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  they were  heavily armed.  they fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly,  and they were never fired back on.  we did everything we could to  avoid the loss of life.  they made the decision to immolate  themselves.  and i regret it terribly, and i feel awful about the  children.   	      	     but in the end, the last comment i had from janet reno,  is when -- and i talked to her on sunday -- i said, now, i want you  to tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why  you believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  and she  said, it's because of the children.  they have evidence that those  children are still being abused and that they're in increasingly  unsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier  with time -- with the passage of time.  i have to take their word for  that.  so that is where i think things stand. 	      	     q	  can we assume then that you don't think this was  mishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of  patience?  and if you had it to do over again, would you really  decide that way? 	      	     the president:  no -- well, i think what you can assume  is just exactly what i announced today.  this is a -- the fbi has  done a lot of things right for this country over a long period of  time.  this is the same fbi that found the people that bombed the  world trade center in lickety-split, record time.  we want an inquiry  to analyze the steps along the way.  is there something else we  should have known?  is there some other question they should have  asked?  is there some other question i should have asked?  can i say  for sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make  the outcome come different?  i don't know that.  that's why i want  the inquiry and that's why i would like to make sure that we have  some independent law enforcement people, not political people, but  totally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best  evidence we have.   	      	     there is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of  fanaticism all across the world.  and we may have to confront it  again.  and i want to know whether there is anything we can do,  particularly when there are children involved.  but i do think it is  important to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the  people who killed others and then killed themselves. 	      	     q	  mr. president, were there any other options  presented to you for resolving this situation at any point from  february 28th until yesterday? 	      	     the president:  well, yes, i got regular reports all  along the way.  there were lots of other options pursued.  if you go  back -- you all covered it very well.  the fbi -- you did a very good  job of it.  i mean, the fbi and the other authorities there pursued  any number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them  early on seemed to be working.  some of the children got out, some of  the other people left.  there was a -- at one point, there seemed to  be some lines of communication opening up between koresh and the  authorities.  and then he would say things and not do them and things  just began to spin downward.   	      	     whether there were other -- in terms of what happened  yesterday, the conversation i had with the attorney general did not  involve other options except whether we should take more time with  the present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they  wanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get  people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves.   that's what they thought. 	      	     q	  did the government know that the children did not  have gas masks? 	      	     q	     congressional hearings once the situation -- are  you in agreement with that? 	      	     the president:  that's up to the congress.  they can do  whatever they want.  but i think it's very important that the  treasury and justice departments launch this investigation and bring  in some outside experts.  and as i said in my statement, if any  congressional committees want to look into it, we will fully  cooperate.  there is nothing to hide here.  this was probably the  most well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the  country. 	      	     go ahead, sarah. 	      	     q	  there are two questions i want to ask you.  the  first is, i think that they knew very well that the children did not  have gas masks while the adults did, so the children had no chance  because this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal, but it was  very dangerous to the children and they could not have survived  without gas masks.  and on february 28th -- let's go back -- didn't  those people have a right to practice their religion? 	      	     the president:  they were not just practicing their  religion, they were -- the treasury department believed that they had  violated federal laws, any number of them. 	      	     q	  what federal laws -- 	      	     the president:  let me go back and answer -- i can't  answer the question about the gas masks, except to tell you that the  whole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; they  were convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but  it would force anybody that breathed it to run outside.  and one of  the things that i've heard -- i don't want to get into the details of  this because i don't know -- but one of the things that they were  speculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that  the windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have  escaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect.   	      	     they also knew, sarah, that there was an underground  compound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be  sent.  and they were -- i think they were hoping very much that if  the children were not released immediately outside that the humane  thing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace  where they could be protected.   	      	     in terms of the gas masks themselves, i learned  yesterday -- i did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas  was supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks  themselves were to work.  so that it was thought that even if they  all had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in a  nonviolent, nonshooting circumstance. 	      	     ms. myers:  last question. 	      	     q	  mr. president, why are you still saying that -- 	      	     q	  could you tell us whether or not you ever asked  janet reno about the possibility of a mass suicide?  and when you  learned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your  mind during those horrendous moments? 	      	     the president:  what i asked janet reno is if they had  considered all the worse things that could happen.  and she said -- and, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the  public -- he had -- that had been debated anyway.  and she said that  the people who were most knowledgeable  about these kinds of issues  concluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would  be tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in  the future.  that was the judgment they made.  whether they were  right or wrong, of course, we will never know.  	      	     what happened when i saw the fire, when i saw the  building burning?  i was sick.  i felt terrible.  and my immediate  concern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were  escaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up.   that's the first thing i wanted to know.   	      	     thank you. 	      	     q	  mr. president, why are you still saying it was a  janet reno decision?  isn't it, in the end, your decision? 	      	     the president:  well, what i'm saying is that i didn't  have a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the fbi.  i didn't  go over every strategic part of it.  it is a decision for which i  take responsibility.  i'm the president of the united states and i  signed off on the general decision and giving her the authority to  make the last call.  when i talked to her on sunday, some time had  elapsed.  she might have made a decision to change her mind.  i said,  if you decide to go forward with this tomorrow, i will support you.  and i do support her.   	      	     she is not ultimately responsible to the american  people; i am.  but i think she has conducted her duties in an  appropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation i think as  well as she could have.   	      	     thank you.

": recently an e-mail to me mentioned:  : (technically, the messengers aren't even human so : it *can't* be a case of ""homosexuality"" -- even of rape.) [...]  : the jude reference to sodom is also meaningful only in the context of : the sodomites' ""lust"" for the ""other flesh"" of angels.  again, : application to homosexual behavior in general, or to the position of : gay christians is largeely specious. : *** : are angels ""flesh""? no. i feel that this is saying that it was because : of their lust after other men, who are flesh( or of this world).  : what are other opinons on this? i haven't heard much about this verse   : at all.  bo reike in the anchor bible volume on _james, peter, and jude_ points out that all the examples given in this section of jude are distinguishing the elect from _apostates_, not just the wicked in general.  hence, those who were delivered from egypt, but did not follow moses (and, by extension, god); the apostate angels; and sodom and gomorrah.  quoting reike:  	""fornication may here, as often in the new testament, 	refer to idolatry, while ""flesh"" (as in i pet 1:24)  	denotes human society and its violent attempts at self- 	exaltation.  sodom and gommorrah represent the leaders 	of apostasy, and the surrounding cities correspond to 	their followers."" [p. 199]   there is no inherent reason to read this verse (7) as literally referring to actual sexual lust for ""alien flesh"".  nor is it inherently necessary to understand it as referring to homosexuality, outside of the circular reasoning that has already concluded that the sin of sodom is the sin of homosexuality.  the only place that the sin of sodom is specified, and not merely inferred, is in ezekiel 16:49 ""this was the guilt of your sister sodom: she and her daughters had pride, excess of food, and prosperous ease, bit did not aid the poor and needy.  they were haughty, and did abominable things before me; therefore i removed them when i saw it.  for the same reason (overliteralizing the text) your correspondent's suggestion that the reason the passage doesn't deal with homosexuality is because the guests were angels and not men is just silly.  there  are much more solid reasons for pointing out the irrelevance of the sodom passages for dealing with homosexuality per se.",15,soc.religion.christian

"yep, that's pretty much it. i'm not a jew but i understand that this is the jewish way of thinking. however, the jews believe that the covenant between yhwh and the patriarchs (abraham and moses, in this case) establishes a moral code to follow for mankind. even the jews could not decide where the boundaries fall, though.  as i understand it, the sadducees believed that the torah was all that was required, whereas the pharisees (the ancestors of modern judaism) believed that the torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding of the required morality in all its nuances (->talmud).  the essence of all of this is that biblical morality is an interface between man and yhwh (for a jew or christian) and does not necessarily indicate anything about yhwh outside of that relationship (although one can speculate).   the trouble with all of this is that we don't really know what the ""created in his image"" means. i've heard a number of different opinions on this and have still not come to any conclusion. this rather upsets the apple cart if one wants to base a life script on this shaky foundation (to mix metaphors unashamedly!) as to living by christ's example, we know very little about jesus as a person. we only have his recorded utterances in a set of narratives by his followers, and some very small references from comtemporary historians. revelation aside, one can only ""know"" christ second-hand or worse.  this is not an attempt to debunk christianity (although it may seem that way initially), the point i`m trying to make is that we only really have the bible to interpret, and that interpretation is by humanity. i guess this is where faith or relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness.   no. there may be an absolute moral code. there are undoubtably multiple moral codes. the multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral code. as an example, a parent may tell a child never to swear, and the child may assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told the child that it is ""wrong"". now, the parent may swear like a trooper in the pub or bar (where there are no children). the ""wrongness"" here is if the child disobeys the parent. the parent may feel that it is ""inappropriate"" to swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of animals. the analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that he is of the same type as the parent (and may be a parent later in life) but you get the gist of it? incidentally, the young child considers the directive as absolute until he gets older (see piaget) and learns a morality of his own.  david.  --- on religion:",19,talk.religion.misc

"yeh,but :  1.biran sutter's playoff record as the head coach in st.l wasn't very impressive. his blues teams were eliminated very early in the playoffs. it doesn't look like this trend will change with the bruins.  2. bruins have never come back to win after falling behind 2-0 in their entire 68-year history. it doesn't look like buffalo will just lose their next two games at the aud with the way fuhr has been standing on his head.  basically,the bruins will be on the golf course by next weekend. also,it seems like the whole boston area has gone baseball crazy after an incredibly great start by the red sox(best record in their major leagues as of now). i would say that 70% of the callers to the bruins' flagship station(sportsradio 590) are talking about the red sox,about 15% are yapping about the patriots' upcoming draft,10% are on the celtics and about 5% are on the bruins. somehow,no one around here is really schocked the way bruins are folding early.",10,rec.sport.hockey

"note: these trial updates are summarized from reports in the _idaho statesman_ and the local nbc affiliate television station, ktvb channel 7.  randy weaver/kevin harris trial update: day 4.  friday, april 16, 1993 was the fourth day of the trial.  synopsis: defense attorney gerry spence cross-examined agent cooper under repeated objections from prosecutor ronald howen.  spence moved for a mistrial but was denied.  the day was marked by a caustic cross-examination of deputy marshal larry cooper by defense attorney gerry spence.  although spence has not explicitly stated so, one angle of his stategy must involve destroying the credibility of agent cooper.  cooper is the government's only eyewitness to the death of agent degan. spence attacked cooper's credibility by pointing out discrepancies between cooper's statements last september and those made in court. cooper conceded that, ""you have all these things compressed into a few seconds...it's difficult to remember what went on first.""  cooper acknowledged that he carried a ""9mm colt commando submachine gun with a silenced barrel."" [i thought a colt commando was a revolver!] cooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specific plans to use the weapon when they started to kill weaver's dog.  when spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by degan's m-16 rifle when degan was apparently dead, cooper could not say for sure that degan did not return fire before going down.  spence continued by asking with how many agents (and to what extent) had cooper discussed last august's events, cooper responded, ""if you're implying that we got our story together, you're wrong, counselor.""  spence continued to advance the defense's version of the events: namely, that a marshal had started the shooting by killing the weaver's dog.  cooper disagreed.  assistant u.s. attorney ronald howen repeatedly objected to spence's virulent cross-examination of agent cooper, arguing that the questions were repetitive and spence was wasting time.  howen also complained  that spence was improperly using a cross-examination to advance the defense's version of the events.  u.s. district judge edward lodge sustained many of the objections; however, both lawyers persisted until judge lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded to admonish both attorneys.  ""i'm not going to play games with either counsel.  this has been a personality problem from day 1, so start acting like professionals.""  spence told the judge that, ""when all the evidence is in, we'll see that ... his [agent larry cooper] testimony is not credible, that he was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events.""  spence continued, ""we're going to find...that there is a very unlikely similarity - almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter - between the testimony of mr. cooper and the other witnesses.""  spence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that howen's repeated objections would prevent a fair trial, ""we can't have a fair trial if the jury believes i'm some sort of charlatan, if the jury believes i'm bending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that i'm violating court orders.""  judge lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of howen's objections had somehow prejudiced the jury was ""preposterous"" and denied the motion for a mistrial.  lodge did tell howen to restrict his comments when objecting.  the trial resumed with the prosecution calling fbi special agent greg rampton.  the prosecution's purpose was simply to introduce five weapons found in the cabin as evidence: however, the defense seized on the opportunity to further address cooper's credibility.  defense attorney ellison matthews (harris' other attorney) questioned rampton about the dog.  rampton stated that there were no specific plans to kill the weaver's dog without being detected.  matthews then had rampton read  a septtember 15, 1992 transcript in which rampton had said that cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weapon was to kill the dog without being detected, if the dog chased them. rampton then acknowledged that he believed that cooper had said that, but he could not remember when.  he then stated that, ""i did not conduct the primary interview with deputy cooper, but i have had conversations with him since the interview was conducted.""",16,talk.politics.guns

(basically everyone you don't like), i think that your phrase ""do not comprise a `political minorit[y]`"" (why the brackets?) is a non-sequiteur.  gay groups exist which lobby their governments. that is a fact.  prove it false.  hence they are a politial group.  you  state that they are not a political minority.  are they therefore a political majority?  i think you boobed really big on this one.  try thinking about your arguments.   prove the first statement please.   dates, phone numbers, &c.  again your logic fails.  again you make statements which you cannot (and most probably will not) maintain.  you state that a person (girl, in this context) who considers equal rights for all humans to be an airhead?  as clayton (your best mate?) would say: it just shows how screwed up you are.     proof please.  proof that homosexuality is not part of the natural order. proof that nature has always asserted itself.  are you saying that nature is a conciousness?  are you pretending that you have the ability to see the future?  are you god(tm)?  in fact, by your arguement, are you waiting for  the black people to become slaves again?  because they were reviled as sub-human (nb: *not* my view) at one time?  again your arguement falls on its ass.    touchy touchy touchy!  right.  i have shot holes in each and every one of your arguements.  you are most probably going to put me in your kill file because you have no answers to my questions and challenges.  since you cannot support your arguments it merely goes to show that what you write is based upon your personal prejudices, and cannot be taken to be fact of any kind.  i await an intelligent response.....",18,talk.politics.misc

[2]  why use jpeg?  there are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.  making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images.  being able to compress a 2 mbyte full-color file down to 100 kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time!  (if you are comparing gif and jpeg, the size ratio is more like four to one.  more details below.)  if your viewing software doesn't support jpeg directly, you'll have to convert jpeg to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  even with a jpeg-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simpler format (gif, for instance).  thus, using jpeg is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply.  it's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file.  i'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.  the other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif as a standard usenet posting format is that jpeg can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel (16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  if you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you.  within a couple of years, though, 8-bit gif will look as obsolete as black-and-white macpaint format does today.  furthermore, for reasons detailed in section 7, jpeg is far more useful than gif for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware.  hence jpeg is considerably more appropriate than gif for use as a usenet posting standard.   [3]  when should i use jpeg, and when should i stick with gif?  jpeg is *not* going to displace gif entirely; for some types of images, gif is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  one of the first things to learn about jpeg is which kinds of images to apply it to.  as a rule of thumb, jpeg is superior to gif for storing full-color or gray-scale images of ""realistic"" scenes; that means scanned photographs and similar material.  jpeg is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display hardware, and it is a lot superior if you do.  (see section 7 for details.)  gif does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors, such as cartoons and line drawings.  in particular, large areas of pixels that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by gif.  jpeg can't squeeze these files as much as gif does without introducing visible defects.  this sort of image is best kept in gif form. (in particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in gif files, but they should be avoided in jpeg files.)  jpeg also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  again, this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly often in gif files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  the blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high. if you have a gif with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't jpeg it.  computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  the more complex and subtly rendered the image, the more likely that jpeg will do well on it. the same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).  plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to jpeg. you need at least about 16 gray levels before jpeg is useful for gray-scale images.  it should also be noted that gif is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels, while jpeg is not.  if you have an existing library of gif images, you may wonder whether you should convert them to jpeg.  you will lose a little image quality if you do. (section 7, which argues that jpeg image quality is superior to gif, only applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  if you start from a gif, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; jpeg can only make things worse.)  however, the disk space savings may justify converting anyway.  this is a decision you'll have to make for yourself. if you do convert a gif library to jpeg, see section 14 for hints.  be prepared to leave some images in gif format, since some gifs will not convert well.   [4]  how well does jpeg compress images?  pretty darn well.  here are some sample file sizes for an image i have handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  the first three files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free jpeg software described in section 6b.  file	   size in bytes		comments  ship.ppm	1145040  original file in ppm format (no compression; 24 bits 			 or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead) ship.ppm.z	 963829  ppm file passed through unix compress 			 compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note. 			 other text-oriented compressors give similar results. ship.gif	 240438  converted to gif with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif 			 most of the savings is the result of losing color 			 info: gif saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (see sec. 7.)  ship.jpg95	 155622  cjpeg -q 95    (highest useful quality setting) 			 this is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original, 			 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs. ship.jpg75	  58009  cjpeg -q 75    (default setting) 			 you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this 			 from the original, even with both on-screen at once. ship.jpg50	  38406  cjpeg -q 50 			 this has slight defects; if you know what to look 			 for, you could tell it's been jpeged without seeing 			 the original.  still as good image quality as many 			 recent postings in usenet pictures groups. ship.jpg25	  25192  cjpeg -q 25 			 jpeg's characteristic ""blockiness"" becomes apparent 			 at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some). 			 still, i've seen plenty of usenet postings that were 			 of poorer image quality than this. ship.jpg5o	   6587  cjpeg -q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead) 			 blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or 			 indexing purposes.  note that this file is tiny: 			 the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !  in this case jpeg can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller than a gif of comparable quality (the -q 75 file is every bit as good as the gif, better if you have a full-color display).  this seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes.   [5]  what are good ""quality"" settings for jpeg?  most jpeg compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting.  there seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings.  ""quality 95"" does not mean ""keep 95% of the information"", as some have claimed.  the quality scale is purely arbitrary; it's not a percentage of anything.  the name of the game in using jpeg is to pick the lowest quality setting (smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original.  this setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb.  the default quality setting (-q 75) is very often the best choice.  this setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image.  try -q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  except for experimental purposes, never go above -q 95; saying -q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as -q 95, but of hardly any better quality.  if the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to go down to -q 50 without objectionable degradation.  on the other hand, you might need to go to a higher quality setting to avoid further degradation. the second case seems to apply much of the time when converting gifs to jpeg. the default -q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting gifs (see section 14 for more info).  if you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are prepared to tolerate large defects, a -q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right.  -q 2 or so may be amusing as ""op art"".  (note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free jpeg software described in section 6b, and to many programs based on it.  other jpeg implementations, such as image alchemy, may use a completely different quality scale.  some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just ""high""/""medium""/""low""-style choices.)   [6]  where can i get jpeg software?  most of the programs described in this section are available by ftp. if you don't know how to use ftp, see the faq article ""how to find sources"". (if you don't have direct access to ftp, read about ftpmail servers in the same article.)  that article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with ""send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources"" in the body.  the ""anonymous ftp list faq"" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive.  note: this list changes constantly.  if you have a copy more than a couple months old, get the latest jpeg faq from the news.answers archive.   [6a]  if you are looking for ""canned"" software, viewers, etc:  the first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system.  if you don't see what you want for your machine, check out the portable jpeg software described at the end of the list.  note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.  x windows:  xv (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for jpeg, gif, and many other image formats.  it can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations.  it's available for ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12), file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.z.  version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support for 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking.  if you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  note that version 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll get only 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to jpeg.  but 2.21 works fine for converting gif and other 8-bit images to jpeg.  caution: there is a glitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the ""save at normal size"" checkbox when saving a jpeg file, or the file will be blurry.  another good choice for x windows is john cristy's free imagemagick package, also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/imagemagick.tar.z. this package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  the imagemagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than xv or the basic free jpeg software.  both of the above are large, complex packages.  if you just want a simple image viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports jpeg in its latest release, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage, said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original. (the current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage, at least with respect to jpeg files, because it has the ijg v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  the next xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.z.  both programs are said to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.   ms-dos:  this covers plain dos; for windows or os/2 programs, see the next headings.  one good choice is eric praetzel's free dvpeg, which views jpeg and gif files. the current version, 2.5, is available by ftp from sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  this is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  the user interface is not flashy, but it's functional.  another freeware jpeg/gif/tga viewer is mohammad rezaei's hiview.  the current version, 1.2, is available from simtel20 and mirror sites (see note below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  hiview requires a 386 or better cpu and a vcpi-compatible memory manager (qemm386 and 386max work; windows and os/2 do not).  hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen.  for larger images, it scales the image down to fit on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do). you may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably.  note: installation is a bit tricky; read the directions carefully!  a shareware alternative is colorview for dos ($30).  this is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  its user interface is also much spiffier-looking, although personally i find it harder to use --- more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  it is faster than dvpeg but a little slower than hiview, at least on my hardware.  (for images larger than screen size, dvpeg and colorview seem to be about the same speed, and both are faster than hiview.)  the current version is 2.1, available from simtel20 and mirror sites (see note below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. requires a vesa graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (many recent pcs have a built-in vesa driver, so don't try to load a vesa driver unless colorview complains that the driver is missing.)  a second shareware alternative is fullview, which has been kicking around the net for a while, but i don't know any stable archive location for it. the current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway. the author tells me that a new version of fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the simtel20 archives at that time.  the well-known gif viewer compushow (cshow) supports jpeg in its latest revision, 8.60a.  however, cshow's jpeg implementation isn't very good: it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays.  too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a good jpeg capability in cshow.  shareware, $25.  available from simtel20 and mirror sites (see note below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.  due to the remarkable variety of pc graphics hardware, any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine.  if you can't get *any* of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert jpeg to gif, then view with your favorite gif viewer.  (if you have hi-color hardware, don't use gif as the intermediate format; try to find a targa-capable viewer instead.  vpic5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays.)  the independent jpeg group's free jpeg converters are ftpable from simtel20 and mirror sites (see note below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  these files are dos compilations of the free source code described in section 6b; they will convert jpeg to and from gif, targa, and ppm formats.  handmade software offers free jpeg<=>gif conversion tools, gif2jpg/jpg2gif. these are slow and are limited to conversion to and from gif format; in particular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a jpeg.  the major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write hsi's proprietary jpeg format as well as the usenet-standard jfif format.  since hsi-format files are rather widespread on bbses, this is a useful capability.  version 2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  get it from simtel20 and mirror sites (see note below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip. note: do not use hsi format for files to be posted on internet, since it is not readable on non-pc platforms.  handmade software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package, image alchemy.  this will translate jpeg files (both jfif and hsi formats) to and from many other image formats.  it can also display images. a demo version of image alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from simtel20 and mirror sites (see note below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.  note about simtel20: the internet's key archive site for pc-related programs is simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  simtel20 runs a non-unix system with weird directory names; where this document refers to directory (eg) ""msdos/graphics"" at simtel20, that really means ""pd1:<msdos.graphics>"".  if you are not physically on milnet, you should expect rather slow ftp transfer rates from simtel20.  there are several internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the simtel20 archives; most ftp users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  a popular usa mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps simtel20 files in (eg) ""/pub/msdos/graphics"".  if you have no ftp capability, you can retrieve files from simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  if you are outside the usa, consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest simtel20 mirror is.  microsoft windows:  there are several windows programs capable of displaying jpeg images. (windows viewers are generally slower than dos viewers on the same hardware, due to windows' system overhead.  note that you can run the dos conversion programs described above inside a windows dos window.)  the newest entry is winecj, which is free and extremely fast.  version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip. requires windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  this is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers. but it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...  jview is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the decompressed image in windows bmp format; but it can't create new jpeg files, and it doesn't view gifs.  jview also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's an excellent basic viewer.  the current version, 0.9, is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (mirrors of this archive can be found at some other internet sites, including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)  winjpeg (shareware, $20) displays jpeg,gif,targa,tiff, and bmp image files; it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter. it has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow.  the current version is 2.1, available from simtel20 and mirror sites (see note above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (this is a slow 286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version, which is roughly 25% faster.)  colorview is another shareware entry ($30).  this was an early and promising contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it has no real advantages over winjpeg.  if you want to try it anyway, the current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (i understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with colorview for dos.)  dvpeg (see dos heading) also works under windows, but only in full-screen mode, not in a window.  os/2:  the following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151). note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip     32-bit version of free ijg conversion programs, version 4. /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip     16-bit version of same, for os/2 1.x. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip     image archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with pm graphical interface.     strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  shareware, $15. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip     pmjpeg 1.1: os/2 2.x port of winjpeg, a popular viewer for windows     (see description in windows section).  shareware, $20. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip     pmview 0.85: jpeg/gif/bmp viewer.  gif viewing very fast, jpeg viewing     fast if you have huge amounts of ram, otherwise about the same speed     as the above programs.  strong 24-bit display support.  shareware, $20.  macintosh:  most mac jpeg programs rely on apple's jpeg implementation, which is part of the quicktime system extension; so you need to have quicktime installed. to use quicktime, you need a 68020 or better cpu and you need to be running system 6.0.7 or later.  (if you're running system 6, you must also install the 32-bit quickdraw extension; this is built-in on system 7.)  you can get quicktime by ftp from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. (as of 11/92, this file contains quicktime 1.5, which is better than qt 1.0 in several ways.  with respect to jpeg, it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt jpeg file.  however, some applications seem to have compatibility problems with qt 1.5.)  mac users should keep in mind that quicktime's jpeg format, pict/jpeg, is not the same as the usenet-standard jfif jpeg format.  (see section 10 for details.)  if you post images on usenet, make sure they are in jfif format. most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.  the first choice is probably jpegview, a free program for viewing images that are in jfif format, pict/jpeg format, or gif format.  it also can convert between the two jpeg formats.  the current version, 2.0, is a big improvement over prior versions.  get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  requires system 7 and quicktime.  on 8-bit displays, jpegview usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available mac jpeg viewers.  jpegview can view large images in much less memory than other mac viewers; in fact, it's the only one that can deal with jpeg images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4mb mac.  given a large image, jpegview automatically scales it down to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers.  (you can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  some people like this behavior, some don't.  overall, jpegview's user interface is very well thought out.  gifconverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports jfif and pict/jpeg, as well as gif and several other image formats.  the latest version is 2.3.2.  get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  requires system 6.0.5 or later. gifconverter is not better than jpegview as a plain jpeg/gif viewer, but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images.  also, the newest version of gifconverter can load and save jfif images *without* quicktime, so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run quicktime.  (but it's faster with quicktime.) note: if gifconverter runs out of memory trying to load a large jpeg, try converting the file to gif with jpeg convert, then viewing the gif version.  jpeg convert, a mac version of the free ijg jpeg conversion utilities, is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx. this will run on any mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing. you can use it in conjunction with any gif viewer.  previous versions of this faq recommended imagery jpeg v0.6, a jpeg<=>gif converter based on an old version of the ijg code.  if you are using this program, you definitely should replace it with jpeg convert.  apple's free program pictpixie can view images in jfif, quicktime jpeg, and gif format, and can convert between these formats.  you can get pictpixie from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx. requires quicktime.  pictpixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with quicktime. some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display, and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  worse, pictpixie is an unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that apple does not intend to fix.  (there is an old version of pictpixie, called pictcompressor, floating around the net.  if you have this you should trash it, as it's even buggier.  also, the quicktime starter kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of pictpixie called picture compressor.  note that picture compressor is not free and may not be distributed on the net.)  storm technology's picture decompress is a free jpeg viewer/converter. this rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but it will run without system 7 or quicktime, so you may be forced to use it on older systems.  (it does need 32-bit quickdraw, so really old machines can't use it.)  you can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  you must set the file type of a downloaded image file to 'jpeg' to allow picture decompress to open it.  if your machine is too old to run 32-bit quickdraw (a mac plus for instance), gifconverter is your only choice for single-program jpeg viewing.  if you don't want to pay for gifconverter, use jpeg convert and a free gif viewer.  more and more commercial mac applications are supporting jpeg, although not all can deal with the usenet-standard jfif format.  adobe photoshop, version 2.0.1 or later, can read and write jfif-format jpeg files (use the jpeg plug-in from the acquire menu).  you must set the file type of a downloaded jpeg file to 'jpeg' to allow photoshop to recognize it.  amiga:  (most programs listed in this section are stored in the aminet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  there are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one.  in the usa, a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)  hamlab plus is an excellent jpeg viewer/converter, as well as being a general image manipulation tool.  it's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read several formats besides jpeg.  the current version is 2.0.8.  a demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  the demo version will crop images larger than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.  rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display jpeg, ilbm, and gif images.  the program can be used to create animations, even capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like lightwave.  the current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (note: although this directory is supposedly for amigados 3.0 programs, the program will also run under amigados 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)  viewtek is a free jpeg/ilbm/gif/anim viewer.  the current version is 1.04, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/show/viewtek104.lha.  if you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages that support jpeg.  two are written by thomas krehbiel, the author of rend24 and viewtek.  these are cinemorph, a standalone image morphing package, and imagefx, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting, effects and prepress package that also includes cinemorph.  both are distributed by great valley products.  art department professional (adpro), from asdg inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for amigas.  imagemaster, from black belt systems, is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with jpeg support.  the free ijg jpeg software is available compiled for amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file amigajpegv4.lha.  these programs convert jpeg to/from ppm,gif,targa formats.  the amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty jpeg programs, many based on an ancient beta-test version of the free ijg jpeg software (thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without so much as notifying the authors).  among these are ""augjpeg"", ""newamyjpeg"", ""vjpeg"", and probably others i have not even heard of.  in my opinion, anything older than ijg version 3 (march 1992) is not worth the disk space it's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.  atari st:  the free ijg jpeg software is available compiled for atari st, tt, etc, from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo. these programs convert jpeg to/from ppm, gif, targa formats.  for monochrome st monitors, try mgif, which manages to achieve four-level grayscale effect by flickering.  version 4.1 reads jpeg files.  available from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/graphics/mgif41b.zoo.  i have not heard of any other free or shareware jpeg-capable viewers for ataris, but surely there must be some by now?  pointers appreciated.  acorn archimedes:  !changefsi, supplied with risc os 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view jpeg jfif format.  provision is also made to convert images to jpeg, although this must be done from the cli rather than by double-clicking.  recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program translator can handle jpeg, along with about 30 other image formats.  while older versions can be found on some archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by registering with the author, john kortink, nutterbrink 31, 7544 wj, enschede, the netherlands.  price 35 dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).  there's also a commercial product called !jpeg which provides jpeg read/write functionality and direct jpeg viewing, as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options.  this is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs.  contact: dt software, freepost, cambridge, uk.  tel: 0223 841099.   portable software for almost any system:  if none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free jpeg conversion software described in 6b.  you'll also need a viewer program. if your display is 8 bits or less, any gif viewer will do fine; if you have a display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read targa or ppm 24-bit image files.  there are numerous commercial jpeg offerings, with more popping up every day.  i recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  in that case, purchase a hardware-assisted product.  ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final jpeg standard and about whether it can handle the jfif file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.   [6b]  if you are looking for source code to work with:  free, portable c code for jpeg compression is available from the independent jpeg group, which i lead.  a package containing our source code, documentation, and some small test files is available from several places. the ""official"" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9 or 192.48.96.9).  look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release is jpegsrc.v4.tar.z.  (this is a compressed tar file; don't forget to retrieve in binary mode.)  you can retrieve this file by ftp or uucp. if you are on a pc and don't know how to cope with .tar.z format, you may prefer zip format, which you can find at simtel20 and mirror sites (see note above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  this file will also be available on compuserve, in the graphsupport forum (go pics), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip. if you have no ftp access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34. (if you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the faq article ""how to find sources"", referred to at the top of section 6.)  the free jpeg code provides conversion between jpeg ""jfif"" format and image files in gif, pbmplus ppm/pgm, utah rle, and truevision targa file formats. the core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs, such as image viewers.  the package is highly portable; we have tested it on many machines ranging from pcs to crays.  we have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use. companies are welcome to use it as the basis for jpeg-related products. we do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature (see the readme file in the distribution for details). we hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.  the independent jpeg group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.   [7]  what's all this hoopla about color quantization?  most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware. typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  to display a full-color image, the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors.  this process is called ""color quantization"".  (this is something of a misnomer, ""color selection"" would be a better term.  we're stuck with the standard usage though.)  clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  it turns out that for most images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by jpeg (except at the very lowest jpeg quality settings).  since jpeg is a full-color format, converting a color jpeg image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  this is true for *all* color jpegs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color gif into jpeg, what comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors. this happens because jpeg's lossiness affects each pixel a little differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors.  each original color gets ""smeared"" into a group of nearby colors.  therefore quantization is always required to display a color jpeg on a colormapped display, regardless of the image source.  the only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.  (incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a jpeg image.  even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values, different jpeg decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences.  i occasionally see posted images described as ""256-color jpeg"".  this tells me that the poster (a) hasn't read this faq and (b) probably converted the jpeg from a gif. jpegs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but number of colors just isn't a useful concept for jpeg.)  on the other hand, a gif image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors.  (a gif *does* have a definite number of colors in its palette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.) for purposes of usenet picture distribution, gif has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to. this is also the *disadvantage* of gif: you're stuck with the sender's quantization.  if the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image. furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization algorithm, you're out of luck.  for this reason, jpeg offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware. jpeg's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display hardware.  furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of jpeg images you already have.  with a gif, you're stuck forevermore with what was sent.  it's also worth mentioning that many gif-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines.  if you view a 256-color gif on a 16-color ega display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to.  this is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations (one to create the gif, one to display it), but often it's also due to sloppiness.  jpeg conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed.  thus, jpeg is likely to provide better results than the average gif program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!  finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit ""hi-color"" pc displays, true 24-bit displays on workstations and macintoshes, etc.  for these people, gif is already obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display.  jpeg images can drive these displays much more effectively. thus, jpeg is an all-around better choice than gif for representing images in a machine-independent fashion.   [8]  how does jpeg work?  the buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transforms, coefficient quantization, and huffman or arithmetic entropy coding.  this article's long enough already, so i'm not going to say more than that here.  for technical information, see the comp.compression faq. this is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  if you need help in using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.   [9]  what about lossless jpeg?  there's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  the jpeg committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  however, this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy jpeg algorithm, and it offers much less compression.  at present, very few implementations of lossless jpeg exist, and all of them are commercial.  saying ""-q 100"" to the free jpeg software does not get you a lossless image. what it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step.  there is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step.  (with the v4 free jpeg code, you can also say ""-sample 1x1"" to turn off subsampling.  keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)  even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular jpeg algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations.  the maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye, but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.  at this minimum-loss setting, regular jpeg produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  true lossless jpeg provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy.  if you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the jbig bilevel image compression standard.  this performs better than jpeg lossless on such images.  jpeg lossless is superior to jbig on images with 6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, jpeg is public domain (at least with a huffman back end), while the jbig techniques are heavily covered by patents.   [10]  why all the argument about file formats?  strictly speaking, jpeg refers only to a family of compression algorithms; it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  the jpeg committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations.  since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  in the absence of official standards, a number of jpeg program writers have just gone off to ""do their own thing"", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with anybody else's.  the closest thing we have to a de-facto standard jpeg format is some work that's been coordinated by people at c-cube microsystems.  they have defined two jpeg-based file formats:   * jfif (jpeg file interchange format), a ""low-end"" format that transports     pixels and not much else.   * tiff/jpeg, aka tiff 6.0, an extension of the aldus tiff format.  tiff is     a ""high-end"" format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  tiff is     a lot more complex than jfif, and may well prove less transportable,     because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of tiff.  it's not likely that adding jpeg to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation. both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of jpeg-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards.  i believe that usenet should adopt jfif as the replacement for gif in picture postings.  jfif is simpler than tiff and is available now; the tiff 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details.  even when tiff/jpeg is well defined, the jfif format is likely to be a widely supported ""lowest common denominator""; tiff/jpeg files may never be as transportable.  a particular case that people may be interested in is apple's quicktime software for the macintosh.  quicktime uses a jfif-compatible format wrapped inside the mac-specific pict structure.  conversion between jfif and quicktime jpeg is pretty straightforward, and several mac programs are available to do it (see mac portion of section 6a).  if you have an editor that handles binary files, you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif by hand; see section 11 for details.  another particular case is handmade software's programs (gif2jpg/jpg2gif and image alchemy).  these programs are capable of reading and writing jfif format.  by default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by hsi.  this format is not readable by any non-hsi programs and should not be used for usenet postings.  use the -j switch to get jfif output.  (this applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit jfif format by default.  you still should be careful not to post hsi-format files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-pc platforms.)   [11]  how do i recognize which file format i have, and what do i do about it?  if you have an alleged jpeg file that your software won't read, it's likely to be hsi format or some other proprietary jpeg-based format.  you can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:  1.  a jfif-standard file will start with the characters (hex) ff d8 ff e0,     followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'jfif'.  2.  if you see ff d8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a     ""raw jpeg"" file.  this is probably decodable as-is by jfif software ---     it's worth a try, anyway.  3.  hsi files start with 'hsi1'.  you're out of luck unless you have hsi     software.  portions of the file may look like plain jpeg data, but they     won't decompress properly with non-hsi programs.  4.  a macintosh pict file, if jpeg-compressed, will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a jfif header (scan for 'jfif').  strip off     everything before the ff d8 and you should be able to read it.  5.  anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not jpeg at all.  if you are     lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream.     if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream (look for ff d8),     try stripping off everything before that.  in uuencoded usenet postings, the characteristic jfif pattern is  	""begin"" line 	m_]c_x ...  whereas uuencoded hsi files will start with  	""begin"" line 	m:'-i ...  if you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-jfif files.   [12]  what about arithmetic coding?  the jpeg spec defines two different ""back end"" modules for the final output of compressed data: either huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed. the choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file.  on typical images, arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than huffman coding.  (all the file-size numbers previously cited are for huffman coding.)  unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the jpeg standard is subject to patents owned by ibm, at&t, and mitsubishi. thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses from these companies.  (the ""fair use"" doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best.)  at least in the short run, i recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the potential legal hassles.  in particular, arithmetic coding *should not* be used for any images to be exchanged on usenet.  there is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future.  stay tuned for further details.   [13]  does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?  it would be nice if, having compressed an image with jpeg, you could decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially. unfortunately this is not the case.  in general, recompressing an altered image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the first time around.  the next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an identical jpeg file.  even this is not true; at least, not with the current free jpeg software.  it's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error.  if you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output.  (it usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.) one of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited, but i am not optimistic about it.  in any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original quality setting, would introduce no further loss.  even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation. (if you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move. if you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but that's a mighty limited capability!)  the bottom line is that jpeg is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  use a lossless format (ppm, rle, tiff, etc) while working on the image, then jpeg it when you are ready to file it away.  aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way :-).   [14]  what are some rules of thumb for converting gif images to jpeg?  as stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing gif image to jpeg.  if you can obtain the original full-color data the gif was made from, it's far better to make a jpeg from that.  but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from, here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality.  the first rule when converting a gif library is to look at each jpeg, to make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding gif; that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary.  some gifs may be better left as gifs, as explained in section 3; in particular, cartoon-type gifs with sixteen or fewer colors don't convert well.  you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be *larger* than the gif.  (so check the sizes too.)  experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality gifs are the best candidates for conversion to jpeg.  they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings, and they convert to jpeg with least degradation. don't waste your time converting any gif much under 100 kbytes.  also, don't expect jpeg files converted from gifs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals.  to maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through jpeg files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the gif file, not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).  many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a gif image.  while useless, this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in gif files.  it is not free in jpeg files, and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts (""ghost"" edges).  do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpeging.  (if you are on an x windows system, xv's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this.)  cjpeg's default q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but for gif inputs, q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation.  (if you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher q setting may not be necessary.)  color gifs of photographs or complex artwork are usually ""dithered"" to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that gif can actually store. if you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  the trouble with dithering is that, to jpeg, it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise; and jpeg can't compress noise very well.  the resulting jpeg file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from jpeging the original full color image (if you had it). to get around this, you want to ""smooth"" the gif image before compression. smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give jpeg trouble.  appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high q factor, thus further reducing the size of the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image than you'd get without smoothing.  with the v4 free jpeg software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing capability is built in.  try ""-smooth 10"" or so when converting gifs. values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality gifs.  heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (if you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the gif image even without enlargement, then strong smoothing is definitely called for.)  too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image, which you don't want.  if you are an image processing wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as pnmconvol from the pbmplus package.  however, cjpeg's built-in smoother is a lot faster than pnmconvol...  the upshot of all this is that ""cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10"" is probably a good starting point for converting gifs.  but if you really care about the image, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.   ---------------------  for more information about jpeg in general or the free jpeg software in particular, contact the independent jpeg group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.",1,comp.graphics

"flash over is a frequent occurrence with indoor fires.  a fire will start small and in one location and heat the air.  the temperature in the room builds up and then everything inflammable in the room catches fire at once.   this may have occurred in the bd compound, i have heard reports that the windows were covered which would permit a fire to start unnoticed by those outside the compound.  when the fire got big enough, and broke through the walls, it appeared to be started in two places but was really one big fire.   because of the large quantities of tear gas inserted into the building it is possible that many of the women and children were in a room free of tear gas they would try to seal the door to keep out the tear gas. when they learned that a fire had broken out it was too late for them to escape.  they were trapped by the flames in their safe room.   i find it hard to believe that the fbi was not recording the final assault.  i think that they would have wanted to have tapes to show their agents of the the fbi overcoming the ""forces of evil"", aka the branch davidians.  the tapes would also allow the fbi to prove that they were not using excessive force.",16,talk.politics.guns

"the following was posted and no doubt retyped by yigal ahrens and considering   the importance of the issue and the almost total blackout except in   california, i am reposting to other appropriates groups.        from la times, friday, april 9, 1993.  p. a1.    evidence of adl spy operation seized by police    by richard c. paddock, times staff writer    san francisco -- police on thursday served search warrants on the  anti-defamation league here and in los angeles, seizing evidence of a  nationwide intelligence network accused of keeping files on more than  950 political groups, newspapers and labor unions and as many as  12,000 people.    describing the spy operation in great detail, san francisco  authorities simultaneously released voluminous documents telling how  operatives of the anti-defamation league searched through trash and  infiltrated organizations to gather intelligence on arab-american,  right-wing and what they called ""pinko"" organizations.    representatives of the anti-defamation league, a well-known  organization in the u.s. jewish community dedicated to fighting  anti-semitism, declined detailed comment thursday but denied breaking  any laws.    police allege that the organization maintains undercover operatives to  gather political intelligence in at least seven cities, including los  angeles and san francisco.    groups that were the focus of the spy operation span the political  spectrum, including such groups as the ku klux klan, the white aryan  resistance, operation rescue, greenpeace, the national assn. for the  advancement of colored people, the united farm workers and the jewish  defense league.  also on the list were mills college, the board of  directors of san francisco public television station kqed and the san  francisco bay guardian newspaper.    people who were subjects of the spy operation included former  republican rep. pete mccloskey, jailed political extremist lyndon h.  larouche and los angeles times foreign correspondent scott kraft, who  is based in south africa.    authorities said much of the material collected by the groups was  confidential information obtained illegally from law enforcement  agencies.  they also alleged that data on some individuals and  organizations was sold separately to the south african government.    in addition to allegations of obtaining confidential information from  police, the anti-defamation league could face a total of 48 felony  counts for not properly reporting the employment of its chief west  coast spy, roy bullock, according to the affidavit filed to justify  the search warrant.    the anti-defamation league disguised payments to bullock for more than  25 years by funneling $550 a week to beverly hills attorney bruce i.  hochman, who then paid bullock, according to the documents released in  san francisco.  hochman, a former president of the jewish federation  council of greater los angeles and one of the state's leading tax  attorneys, will be out of the city until late next week and could not  be reached for comment, his office said.    until 1990, hochman, a former u.s. prosecutor, also was a member of a  panel appointed by then-sen. pete wilson to secretly make initial  recommendations on new federal judges in california.  hochman is a  former regional president of the anti-defamation league.    the league, which initially cooperated with police, has denied  repeatedly that its intelligence-gathering operation broke any laws.  league officials will not confirm or deny whether bullock was an  employee and have said they simply traded information with police  departments about people who might be involved in hate crimes.    but in an affidavit filed to obtain warrants for thursday's searches,  san francisco police alleged that ""adl employees were apparently less  than truthful"" in providing information during an earlier search  conducted without a warrant.    david lehrer, executive director of the los angeles adl office, said  the organization has not violated the law.  ""there is nothing  nefarious about how we operate or what we have done,"" he said.  ""our  record speaks for itself.""    the police affidavit contends that lehrer had sole control of a secret  fund used to pay for ""fact-finding operations.""  lehrer, according to  the documents, signed checks from the account under the name l.  patterson.    an adl official said the account was used to pay for subscriptions to  a wide variety of extremist publications that might balk at sending  them directly to the anti-defamation league.    bullock, 58, who has been collecting intelligence for the adl for  nearly 40 years, defended his efforts during a lengthy interview with  san francisco police.  he said that he gathered names from many  sources and entered them into his computer under headings such as  ""skins"" and ""pinkos,"" but that did not necessarily mean that they were  under surveillance.    ""i might never see or call up on 99% of them again,"" bullock said.  ""and it doesn't mean anything that they're in the files.  it's not a  threat to anyone's civil rights that a name appears in my files under,  say, 'pinko.'""    in recent years, bullock worked closely with san francisco police  officer tom gerard, who fled to the phillippines last fall after he  was questioned by the fbi in the case.    a former cia employee, gerard supplied bullock with criminal records  and department of motor vehicles information such as home addresses,  vehicle registration, physical characteristics and drivers license  photographs.    using files gathered for the anti-defamation league, gerard and  bullock also provided information to the south african government,  receiving $16,000 over four years, the documents show.    the file on times staff writer kraft, which was apparently sold to the  south african government, provides some insight into the hit-and-miss  nature of the spy operation.    the file notes that kraft's articles ""appear frequently in the times  and are well researched and written,"" but little else about the file  is accurate.  the brief entry confuses the times' kraft with another  scott kraft and provides the south african government with the wrong  kraft's physical description, photograph and other personal  information.    nevertheless, the documents provide illuminating details of how  bullock for decades infiltrated all manner of organizations, from  skinheads to left-wing radicals, searching regularly through the trash  of target groups.  using anti-defamation league funds, he also ran his  own paid informants under code names such as ""scott"" and ""scumbag.""    he worked closely with police officers up and down the coast,  exchanged information with the fbi and worked with federal agencies,  including the bureau of alcohol, tobacco and firearms.    it was bullock's work as a paid informant for the fbi -- while spying  on behalf of the anti-defamation league and the south african  government -- that proved his undoing. the fbi learned that he was an  agent of a foreign government and began investigating, leading to the  probe of the anti-defamation league's intelligence network.  the  anti-defamation league employed undercover operatives to gather  information in los angeles, san francisco, new york, washington,  chicago, st. louis and atlanta, according to the affidavit and  investigators.  joining san francisco police in searching league  offices and a los angeles bank were investigators from the office of  san francisco dist. atty. arlo smith and the state franchise tax  board.  the los angeles police department, which earlier refused to  cooperate with the investigation, was informed of the searches in los  angeles but not invited to participate.  investigators suspect that  some confidential information in the anti-defamation league files may  have come from los angeles police officers.        from los angeles times, saturday, april 10, 1993.  p. a23.    adl vows to cooperate with spy investigation    by richard c. paddock, times staff writer.    san francisco -- the anti-defamation league defended its record as a  civil rights group friday and said it will cooperate with authorities  who are investigating whether the organization collected confidential  police information on citizens and groups.    but san francisco dist. atty. arlo smith said that anti-defamation  league employees involved in intelligence gathering could face many  felony counts of receiving confidential files, eavesdropping, tax  violations and conspiracy.    police have accused the anti-defamation league of not being truthful  about its spying operations, which collected information on more than  12,000 individuals and 950 political groups across the political  spectrum.    hundreds of pages of documents released by prosecutors thursday show  that the adl maintained a nationwide intelligence network and kept  files on political figures.    even so, smith suggested that if the anti-defamation league shut down  its spy operation, prosecutors would take that into account when  deciding what charges to file.    in a statement released in washington, national director abraham h.  foxman described the adl as ""a jewish defense agency which has fought  to protect all minorities from bigotry and discrimination for 80  years.""    foxman said the organization is regarded as a credible source on  extremist groups and has a tradition of routinely providing  information to police, journalists, academics, government officials  and the public.  it has never been the policy of the adl to obtain  information illegally, he said.    ""like other journalists, in order to protect the confidentiality and  physical safety of its sources, adl will not comment on the nature or  identity of any source of information,"" foxman said.    the anti-defamation league refused to acknowledge that one of its  longtime employees, roy bullock, was anything more than ""a private  individual who is alleged to be an adl 'informant.'""    among the documents released by prosecutors were detailed statements  showing how the adl funneled weekly payments to bullock through  beverly hills attorney bruce i. hochman.    ""roy would penetrate organizations and needed this arrangement to be  distanced from adl,"" hochman told a san francisco police investigator.  hochman could not be reached friday at his home or office for comment.    despite the anti-defamation league's assertion that it will cooperate  with authorities, san francisco police said the group did not turn  over all pertinent documents during a voluntary search of the group's  offices in los angeles and san francisco last fall.    a second round of searches thursday, this time with search warrants,  produced a vast quantity of records, primarily dealing with financial  transactions, smith said.  further searches may be necessary and it  will be at least a month before any charges are filed, he said.    ""the investigation, of course, will go wherever the facts lead us,""  the district attorney said.",18,talk.politics.misc

"why don't you call the city and ask? oak park also has an illegal handgun ban as well, but does allow those with a ""collectors ffl"" to possess (""collectible?"") handguns.   probably a fine in practical terms.   it wouldn't impede your defense at all. there was an actual incident in oak park where a gas station owner engaged in a shootout with a handgun; the grand jury decided not to presecute. on the other hand, a black man used an illegally owned handgun in oak park to defend himself, and the village tried to make an example out of him. an nra director who lived there made a stink about this, and it was decided not to charge the guy. of course, pissing off anti-gun police thugs has it's own drawbacks, like when the oak park police chief came to his house, and told him: ""this is stepping over the line; this could get dangerous for you."" whereupon the few black oak park police officers watched over his house to ensure that the white anti-gun police chief and his anti-gun cronies wouldn't f*ck with him, his home or family.   l.v. cipriani states that the ""any other weapon"" category is allowed, but the exact relationship between an ithaca auto-burgular, which i believe is in the ""any other weapon"" category and a chopped barrel h&k hk-94 (class 3 for sure) is not clear to me...   in your dreams, buddy. as long as democrats reign in chicago, illinois residents will always be disarmed and helpless in the streets. politicians get around this by provisions in the law that allow them to carry concealed weapons. voters in chicago are too stupid to vote these a**holes out of office; because the dems are always in power, the illinois  supreme court is always tilted to the democratic party's views on guns.

"the problems with catholic liturgy are likely to continue for some time.  the problem is, in a nutshell, this: the liturgy is a symbolic action - in other words catholics do [or should] believe that the _signs_ during the mass - water, blessings, vestments, altar, relics, etc - are real. that is the sprinkling of water bestows real, almost tangible, holiness, the vestments are a real indication of real sacred time. the point of a _symbol_ is that it is understood by all to be connected to an underlying real referent. this kind of thinking precludes analysis; holy water is not holy because of anything, it simply is holy.  but, modern westerners find it extremely difficult, especially if well- educated, to think of the mass as a symbol. we are more likely to see it as a _sign_, ie an action that represents grace, but which could be replaced with other signs. in concrete terms, this means the mass has become a commercial for god's grace rather than the real thing. you can mess around with a commercial in a way you wouldn't dare with the real thing [ask coca-cola co.!]. these attitudes have been encouraged by liturgy workshops, etc. which instead of focusing on _how_ to do do liturgy, have focused on how to create a meaning in liturgy. you can only create signs, symbols have to come from god [or the heart, or somewhere deeper than analysis. the most dramatic example of this shift in understanding has been in the treatment of the sacred species [the consecrated host and wine]. now, with pita bread etc, it is common to come away from the altar with hands covered in particles. if the host is a sign of grace, this isnt and issue; but catholics in the past would have been distraught at this real desacration of the real symbol of jesus' body.  modern catholic liturgy  is caught in this epistemological shift. we try to perfrom the old rites, but then we have some liturgomaniac priest get up and 'explain' what we are doing - so we stop doing it and start pretending to do it. this is not a soul filling experience. it doesn't help btw that we have got stuck witha huge amount of two and three chord ersatz-folk music [again a result of mis-analysis: complicated tunes are in fact easier to remember than simple ones - this was the genius of wesley and the 19c anglican hymn writers]. taize' is only slightly better.  what are we to do? well i suggest rejecting the parish system if it doesn't work for you. search out a church where the liturgy is well prepared not well-explained. they exist in every city. this is not btw a matter of particular style: the music might be old or new. it is the attitude of the church that counts. also, note that a conservative liturgy - harking back to pre-vatican ii days, does not necessarily mean the church will be socially conservative.  in nyc i can recommend: 	corpus christi - w 12st st. 	corpus christi - w 12st st. - very conservative liturgy,  	st. joseph's, greenwich village.  - modern, ""clean"", largely gay 	oratorian church, brooklyn - very beautiful  avoid, anywhere, anytime a church with electric candles.  happy easter: christos aneste', christos voskrezhne, christ is risen",15,soc.religion.christian

"no matter how ""absurd"" it is to suggest that a common moral system created by mankind is absolute, it is not contrary to reason to suggest that a common moral system created by mankind is sensible. in fact, for the bible to be of any use to mankind as a moral code, it must be interpreted by mankind and a workable moral system created for everyday use.  the jewish talmud is the result of centuries of biblical scholars analysing every word of the torah to understand the morality behind it. the children of israel were given a very strict set of moral, civil, judicial and ceremonial laws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance of moral dilemma in their society. for a christian, the situation is no better.  it seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the judeo- christian god is that which is contained in the bible (which we can see from the diverse opinions in the christian newsgroups is not clear). there may well be an absolute morality defined by the judeo-christian god for mankind to follow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was written down by man.  this leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. if we take the divine morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many different ways (as an example, consider the immolation of heretics in the fifteenth century and the interpretation of the bible which allows a man to do that to another man under the precept to administer justice). if we take an agnostic morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit society (with all the danger that this implies). alternatively, we could take the basis of the judeo-christian morality and interpret/extend this to create and justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables the people to live righteously (as many christian and non-christian philosophers have done).  whatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society, i think the important aspect is the result.  david.  --- on religion:",19,talk.religion.misc

"this is the official request for discussion (rfd) for the creation of two new newsgroups for microsoft windows nt.  this is a second rfd, replacing the one originally posted in january '93 (and never taken to a vote).  the proposed groups are described below:  name: 	 comp.os.ms-windows.nt.setup status:  unmoderated. purpose: discussions about setting up and installing windows nt, and about 	 system and peripheral compatability issues for windows nt.  name:	 comp.os.ms-windows.nt.misc status:	 unmoderated. purpose: miscellaneous non-programming discussions about using windows nt, 	 including issues such as security, networking features, console 	 mode and windows 3.1 (win16) compatability.  rationale: 	microsoft nt is the newest member of the microsoft windows family 	of operating systems (or operating environments for those who wish 	to argue about the meaning of an ""os"").  the family ranges from 	modular windows through windows 3.1 and windows for workgroups to 	windows nt at the high end.  to date, microsoft has shipped over 	50,000 beta copies and pre-release sdks of windows nt -- the 	actual release is slated for may/june '93.  	while windows nt has an entirely new design internally, it shares 	an application programming interface with the other members of the 	windows family; its win32 api includes the win16 api used in win- 	dows 3.1, and the win32s api subset (win32 less threads, networking 	and security) can be used to create 32-bit applications for 	windows 3.1.  	the user interface is also practically identical to that of windows 	3.1, with the addition of logins and a few other features.  it uses 	program manager, file manager and other applets, and generally pre- 	sents an identical appearance to the user.  many of the announced 	windows nt applications are ports of existing windows 3.1 apps, and 	nt also runs existing 3.1 applications.  	thus, it appears logical that windows nt should share the following 	groups with the other members of the windows family: 		comp.os.ms-windows.apps 		comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools 		comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.misc 		comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32 	 	the following groups are also clearly applicable to windows nt as 	well as windows 3.1: 		comp.os.ms-windows.announce 		comp.os.ms-windows.advocacy 	 	in conclusion, the only clear argument for the separation of the 	windows 3.1 and windows nt hierarchies is different internal 	structures of windows 3.1 and windows nt.  and yet operating 	systems such as os/2, macintosh os, xenix and coherent all have 	undergone major rewrites without having been split into separate 	newsgroup hierarchies.  	further, windows 3.1 is due for a major rewrite itself in 1994 -- 	when the fully 32-bit, protected-mode and with-dos-built-in next- 	generation windows, ""chicago"", debuts next year, surely it should 	remain in the same hierarchy.  and what, then, would be the jus- 	tification for separating windows nt from other windows versions?   discussion period: 	the discussion period will run from 27 april, 1992 to 18 may, 1993.    voting: 	the cfv (call for votes) will be issued around 19 may, 1993, based on 	the feedback received during the discussion period.  no votes will 	be accepted prior to the cfv.",2,comp.os.ms-windows.misc

"the following document summarizes the clipper chip, how it is used, how programming of the chip is coupled to key generation and the escrow process, and how law enforcement decrypts communications. since there has been some speculation on this news group about my own involvement in this project, i'd like to add that i was not in any way involved.  i found out about it when the fbi briefed me on thursday evening, april 15.  since then i have spent considerable time talking with the nsa and fbi to learn more about this, and i attended the nist briefing at the department of commerce on april 16.   the document below is the result of that effort.   dorothy denning ---------------                       the clipper chip: a technical summary                                 dorothy denning                                  april 19, 1993   introduction  on april 16, the president announced a new initiative that will bring together the federal government and industry in a voluntary program to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement.  at the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption chip called the ""clipper chip"" together with a split-key approach to escrowing keys.  two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from both are needed to reconstruct a key.   chip structure  the clipper chip contains a classified 64-bit block encryption algorithm called ""skipjack.""  the algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared with 56 for the des) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16 for the des).  it supports all 4 des modes of operation.  throughput is 16 mbits a second.  each chip includes the following components:     the skipjack encryption algorithm    f, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips    n, a 30-bit serial number    u, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip   encrypting with the chip  to see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the at&t telephone security device (as it will be).  suppose i call someone and we both have such a device.  after pushing a button to start a secure conversation, my security device will negotiate a session key k with the device at the other end (in general, any method of key exchange can be used).  the key k and message stream m (i.e., digitized voice) are then fed into the clipper chip to produce two values:     e[m; k], the encrypted message stream, and     e[e[k; u] + n; f], a law enforcement block.    the law enforcement block thus contains the session key k encrypted under the unit key u concatenated with the serial number n, all encrypted under the family key f.   chip programming and escrow  all clipper chips are programmed inside a scif (secure computer information facility), which is essentially a vault.  the scif contains a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  about 300 chips are programmed during a single session.  the scif is located at mikotronx.  at the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key escrow agencies enters the vault.  agent 1 enters an 80-bit value s1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters an 80-bit value s2. these values serve as seeds to generate keys for a sequence of serial numbers.  to generate the unit key for a serial number n, the 30-bit value n is first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block n1. s1 and s2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt n1, producing a 64-bit block r1:          r1 = e[d[e[n1; s1]; s2]; s1] .  similarly, n is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce n2 and n3, and two additional 64-bit blocks r2 and r3 are computed:            r2 = e[d[e[n2; s1]; s2]; s1]          r3 = e[d[e[n3; s1]; s2]; s1] .  r1, r2, and r3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. the first 80 bits are assigned to u1 and the second 80 bits to u2.  the rest are discarded.  the unit key u is the xor of u1 and u2.  u1 and u2 are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies.  as a sequence of values for u1, u2, and u are generated, they are written onto three separate floppy disks.  the first disk contains a file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part u1.  the second disk is similar but contains the u2 values.  the third disk contains the unit keys u.  agent 1 takes the first disk and agent 2 takes the second disk.  the third disk is used to program the chips. after the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the vault and the agents leave.  the laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no information is left behind.   the protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the room instead of two.  the first two would provide the seeds s1 and s2, and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to the escrow agencies.  the escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not be the nsa, cia, fbi, or any other law enforcement agency.  one or both may be independent from the government.   law enforcement use  when law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get access to the communications line.  let us assume that the tap is in place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with clipper.  they will first decrypt the law enforcement block with the family key f.  this gives them e[k; u] + n.  they will then take a warrant identifying the chip serial number n to each of the key escrow agents and get back u1 and u2.  u1 and u2 are xored together to produce the unit key u, and e[k; u] is decrypted to get the session key k. finally the message stream is decrypted.  all this will be accomplished through a special black box decoder operated by the fbi.",11,sci.crypt

(deletion)   sorry, but there are worse systems does not say anything about if one could not have a better system.   (deletion)   if we read two stories in the bible, one that god commands people to kill children for being idolaters and another where god kills children directly, what is more important to resolve, the message that children are to be killed or if it has  to be done by god?     and the argument you have given is a fallacy, while it may not be important in the context you have given to find out if god is corporeal or not, it can be crucial in other questions. religious believers resolve contradictions with that they choose one of the possibilities given in an arbitrary way, and have the advantage of being able to attribute their decision to some god.",0,alt.atheism

"this is turning into a faq   here is how to violate your quadra 700 warranty and install your own memory.  1)  insert usual disclaimer here   2)  remove the top lid of the machine. you will see the floppy disk and     hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. follow the usual anti-static     precautions and of course make sure the machine is off when you do     this. unplug the wall and monitor power supply cords from the back 	of the mac.   3)  remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the     tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.     the tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the     tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. you may     also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power     supply. leave that alone. the plastic tab from the tower is all you     need release.   4)  look at the rear of the tower assembly. you will see the flat ribbon     scsi connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable     leading to the floppy drive. disconnect all these from the motherboard.     the hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed     to release it.                                              5)  unplug the drive activity led from its clear plastic mount  6)  look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. a     phillips head screw is at the base. remove it, taking care not to drop     it into the case. a bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful     here.  7)  remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the     right side of the tower. this tab prevents the tower from sliding 	posteriorly. slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then 	lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.  8)  congratulations, you have now gained access to your machine's simm     slots.  9)  the six big slots are for vram. one usually must install all six to     gain useful video modes. all simms (ram or vram)  installed with their 	chips facing the front of the motherboard. 	     the four smaller sockets in front are for ram simms. install simms in 	sets of four into these sockets. be sure you seat the simms squarely 	and firmly into a fully upright position. 	 10) reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the     tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about 	1 cm posterior of its intended position. lower the tower assembly into 	place while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.     once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks     into place. 	 11) reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. dont't forget the floppy     drive cable.  12) replace the phillips head screw  13) drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.  14) plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount",4,comp.sys.mac.hardware

"(sci.space readers can skip the first paragraph)    yesterday, in response to henry spencer's question about the  temperature of a blackbody in interstellar space, i said ""dust grains acts as blackbodies, and they're at 40-150 k.""  well, i was dead wrong.  our local interstellar dust expert, bruce draine, has informed me that dust grains _aren't_ good radiators in the far ir, which is why they are so warm; actually, the ambient radiation field from distant stars can bring a true blackbody to only 3 or 4 kelvin. sorry, henry, and anyone else i misled.  obviously, time for me to take another ism class :-(    in other news, alan stern of the southwest research institute gave a talk on the pluto-charon binary system yesterday.  he gave a brief overview of the currently-accepted system parameters (volume ratio of about 8:1, mass ratio about 15:1 or so, plus lots more...) and then gave his thoughts on the formation of pluto-charon.  his idea is  that there were lots and lots of small planetesimals in the outer solar system, with masses distributed as a power law of some kind; over time, the planetesimals accreted into larger bodies.  most got scattered out of the solar system by close encounters with jupiter and saturn, but many accreted into the gas giants, especially uranus and neptune.  a large planetesimal was captured by neptune - we call it triton [captured how?  perhaps by a collision with a smaller, already-existing neptunian moon, perhaps by a very close passage through neptune's atmosphere - mondo aerobraking!].    he notes that the two recently discovered ""kuiper belt"" objects, 1992 qb1 and 1993 fw, plus chiron and pholus, are all about the same  mass, and he identifies this group as one-accretion-down from the larger bodies of triton and pluto/charon.  pluto/charon, he thinks, formed when an impacting body hit proto-pluto, knocking some material into a ring around pluto which later accreted in charon; similar to ideas about the formation of earth's moon.  there is good evidence from spectra that the surfaces of pluto and charon are very different (pluto has methane frost, charon doesn't), which can be used as evidence for the impact theory.    he believes that there may be around 1000 pluto-to-chiron-sized objects remaining in a relatively stable dynamical zone just outside neptune's  orbit, beyond 35 au or so.  1992 qb1 and 1993 fw are the first members of this population to be found, in his model.  note that such bodies will be very dark, since if their surfaces are covered with methane  frost, it will have photolyzed into very dark, long-chain hydrocarbons by now.  the reason that pluto has such a high albedo (around 0.5, i think) is that its surface warms up just enough around perihelion to sublimate, and when the atmosphere freezes out again, thirty years later, it forms bright, new frost.  so any bodies much farther away than 30 au are going to be very hard to see.    i hope i haven't made any errors in the transcription; if you see a howling mistake, it's undoubtedly mine, not his.    by the way, he's one of the top guns behind the pluto fast flyby mission (i think), and said that the current plans are to use a titan 4 to send the probe on ""just about a rectilinear trajectory"" to pluto (we were speaking loosely at the time...).  he'd like to use a proton, which gives a slightly smaller velocity but costs much less.  his figures: $500 million for 2 titan 4 launches (there will be two separate probes, launched separately), or $120 million for 2 proton launches.  he told a story about how the soviets originally offered to sell proton launches for $30 million each, but were forced to increase their prices in the us in order to be allowed in the marketplace.    i'm just telling you what he said.                            michael",14,sci.space
"being a chronic hbsag carrier does not necessarily mean the patient has chronic persistent anything. persons who are chronic carriers may have no clinical, biochemical, or histologic evidence of liver disease, or they may have chronic persistent hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma.  most cases of chronic persistent hepatitis (cph) are probably the result of a viral infection, although in a good number of cases the cause cannot be determined. the diagnosis of cph is made on the basis of liver biopsy. it consists of findings of portal inflammation, an intact periportal limiting plate, and on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis. but in contrast to chronic active hepatitis (cah) there is no periportal inflammation,  bridging necrosis, or fibrosis.   cph has, indeed, an excellent prognosis. if i had to choose between cah and cph there is no question i would also choose cph. however, as david pointed out, the distinction between the two is not as neat as some of us would have it. the histology can sometimes be pretty equivocal, with biopsies showing areas compatible with both cph and cah. maybe it is a sampling problem. maybe it is a continuum. i don't know.  =================================",13,sci.med

"[stuff deleted]  i agree with the flavor of this post, but disagree with one specific argument.  that ""has great hands"" means nothing.  it seems to me that a first-baseman's defensive value is not entirely (or even primarily) from his ability to field grounders or catch popups.  how many such chances does he get during a game?  many fewer than he gets chances to catch throws from 2b,ss,3b and p (i mean the total of these is much higher than grounder/popup totals).  this implies to me that there is value in catching these throws well, even if they are high, up-the-line or in the dirt.  ""good hands"" are needed for such plays, and thus have value.  i don't have any numbers for the relative number of occurences of these plays, but i'd guess that the values of these abilities are similar.  it's just like: you don't judge catcher's defense primarily on how they field bunts and popups.

""basically what we've done by going to five evas rather than three is to repackage our margin so that we have the capability to respond to the dynamics, or unknowns, of spacewalks,"" mission director randy brinkley said. ""it improves the probabilities for mission success while providing added flexibility and adaptability for reacting to real-time situations.""  	in laying out the specific tasks to be completed on each of the spacewalks, officials have determined that changing out the gyros, solar arrays and the wide field/planetary camera (wf/pc) and installing the corrective optics space telescope axial replacement (costar) are priority objectives during the mission.  	""when we looked at accomplishing all of the tasks, highest through lowest priority, and recognizing that the major tasks -- gyros, solar arrays, wf/pc and costar -- would consume most of the time set aside for each spacewalk, five evas were deemed appropriate,"" said milt heflin, lead flight director for the mission.  	while the five spacewalks will be unprecedented, the use of two alternating spacewalk teams will alleviate placing more stress on the crew than previous missions requiring two, three or four evas.  	""we have paid close attention to lessons learned during previous spacewalks and factored these into our timeline estimates for five evas,"" heflin said.  ""in planning for all space shuttle missions, it is necessary to formulate a work schedule that represents as realistic a timeline as possible to accomplish the mission objectives.""  	planning currently calls for at least five water tank training sessions that include support from the mission control center, called joint integrated simulations, lasting between 10 and 36 hours.  in addition, many stand alone underwater training ""runs"" will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk.  	various refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be made based on actual training experience during the months prior to the mission.  also, lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flight will be valuable in assisting the sts-61 crew in its training techniques.  	endeavour's june flight and discovery's july mission both will include spacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the hst mission. the evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between the actual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks at the johnson space center, houston, and the marshall space flight center, huntsville, ala.  	also, the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gaining further insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand the experience levels among the astronaut corps, the flight controllers and trainers.  	designed to be serviced by a space shuttle crew, hubble was built with grapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures.  	the telescope was launched aboard discovery in april 1990.  at that time the nasa mixed fleet manifest showed the first revisit mission to hst in 1993 to change out science instruments and make any repairs that may have become necessary.",14,sci.space

"zoroastrianism san jose, ca, usa monday april 5, 1993 san jose mercury news, page 1      [reproduced without permission]  _3,700-year tradition still glows -             'assimilation in u.s. threatens ancient zoroastrian religion'_  by jeanne huber, mercury news staff writer     high on a hillside above san jose, flames leap up 24 hours a day from a gleaming brass urn in a temple - one of only four in the united states - dedicated to one of the world's most ancient religions.     with the flames go the prayers of about 1,200 bay area zoroastrians that their faith will survive this land.     ""there is a fear - a real fear, too,"" said silloo tarapore of lafayette. ""we have one generation to do it or to die.""     many immigrant groups struggle to maintain an identity in a strange land. but for zoroastrians, it is an especially poignant concern.     their religion has been around for perhaps 3,700 years, a heritage so deep it scarcely seems comprehensible in a state where ""historical sites"" are sometimes less than 100 years old.  it was the religion of the great persian empire under kings cyrus and darius.  and tradition says that when christ was born about 500 years later, he was honored by a visit from three zoroastrian priests, the magi.  scholars say many key beliefs of christians, jews and muslims can be traced to the teachings of zoroaster, the zoroastrian prophet.     yet, with only about 150,000 zoroastrians in the entire world, they are  a miniscule minority in every country in which they live.  survival as a people is very much on their minds.     ironically, local zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited tolerance of the united states may do what hundreds of years of persecution followed by nearly 1,000 years of benign religious segregation could not do: cause their young people to stop thinking of themselves as zoroastrians.     zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion, and they actually shun the notion of trying to win converts.  so if their children become totally assimilated, they say, it's their children - rather than the world at large - who will be the losers.     ""it's important to have an identity,"" said maneck bhujwaia of san jose, a leader among zoroastrians who came here from india.  ""it's important for everybody - irish, scottish, americans.  it gives meaning to life. you don't have to depend on the majority community to give you respect. you can fall back on your own identity.""     for zoroastrians, there's much to be proud of.     their prophet, zoroaster, seeking to make sense of a culture in which animal sacrifice to multiple gods was common, preached that there was only one god, a good one.  zoroastrians call their god ahura mazda, which translates as lord of wisdom and light.  _good vs. evil_     zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil, with the good eventually winning.  men and women could join in the battle for good, he said, and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequences such as shame and sorrow if they did wrong.  he preached honesty, charity, kindness to animals, respect for the environment, hard work, equality of men and women - basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions.     but zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not to follow him blindly.  he demanded they think for themselves.  in fact, joseph campbell, the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths, traced the western emphasis on individual thought to the zoroastrians.     zoroastrians have many words for thought.  their motto, leaded into a stained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes of mount hamilton, is ""good thoughts, good words, good deeds.""     so it's not surprising that zoroastrians value education highly.  in india, where a contingent of zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escape persecution by muslims in iran, zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacy; the overall statistic in india is just 60 percent.     about half of the bay area zoroastrian community came here from india and pakistan, mostly to study at universities.  the other half fled from iran after the 1979 revolution made that a fundamentalist islamic state where others had no rights.     local zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on ""good deeds"" has improved life in every country they inhabit.  in san jose, the recent restoration of the hotel sainte clarie came about because manou mobedshahi, a san francisco-based hotelier, passed the boarded-up downtown landmark on his way to and from the temple.  at the temple's dedication, the chief guest of honor was the mother of zubin mehta, the zoroastrian conductor of the new york philharmonic orchestra.     the temple exists because of another good deed: the decision by an iranian emigre, the late arbab rustom guiv, to buy land for six temples in north america.  besides the 10-acre site off crothers road on mount hamilton, he paid for land in los angeles, chicago, new york, toronto, and vancouver.  until his gifts, there were no zoroastrian temples on this continent.     local zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple, and the property already had a large house that they have converted to a community center.     the temple, dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet  zoroaster, is a simple structure with gleaming white walls, vaulted  ceilings and oak floors, partially covered with huge oriental carpets.     its central feature is the fire, set in the middle of a partly-glassed- in area at the center of the building.  although zoroastrians are  sometimes called ""fire worshippers,"" they actually consider fire just  a symbol of god.  ""it helps us concentrate, just like christians use the  cross and muslims use the holy book,"" bhujwala said.     the biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring.  for all iranians, including zoroastrians, the new year begins on the first day of the season because of its symbolism as the start of new life.  with zoroaster's birthday just six days later, the combination of religious and secular holidays creates something on par with what most of the united states celebrates between christmas and jan. 1.    for this year's celebration of the prophet's birthday, about 500 people came to worship and revel.     ""the good things in life are not forbidden,"" esfandiar anoushiravani, a leader of the iranian members, had said beforehand, and what followed proved him right.     inside the temple, worshipers filled every chair and sat or stood around the edges of the room as about a half-dozen priests chanted thanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smoking sandalwood, glasses of milk and water, and a tray heaped with dried fruit and nuts.     kids crowded around, grabbing handfuls of the treats.  ""people eat the fruit,"" tarapore said.  ""it's a way to participate in the ceremony.""  _santa claus, sort of_     the gathering even had a santa claus, iranian style.  with flowing white hair and a bag of gifts for the children, this amownaroz wore green symbolic of spring) and red.     he was ushed in by a sort of spring clown, hajefyrouz, who danced and played a tambourine.     the zoroastrians from india were charmed.  ""this is all new for us, too,"" one told a visitor who asked what was going on.     a visitor, john a. sabanovich of folsom, said he became intrigued with the religion years ago while on business trips to iran.  zoroastrians have no procedure for accepting converts - a result, some say, of their centuries of persecution in iran followed by their promise to the hindu king who allowed them into india that they would not interfere with his people's religion.     but that does not stop sabavich from joining in the celebrations at the san jose temple whenever he can.     ""when i first heard about this religion,"" he said, ""i thought, my god, this is what a religion should be.  they think for themselves and do good.     ""people who don't have a tradition, something to lean on, what's the difference with the lower animals?""",19,talk.religion.misc

"the number of civilian iraqi deaths were way over-exaggerated and  exploited for anti-war emotionalism by the liberal news media.  the facts are that less iraqis died in the gulf war than did civilians  in any other war of comparable size this century!  this was due mostly to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques which were technically possible only recently.  the idea that ""hundreds of thousands"" of iraqi citizens died is ludicrous.  not even ""hundreds of thousands"" of iraqi soldiers died, and they were the ones being targeted!  or do you think that the us and its allies were specifically out to kill and maim iraqi civilians? either the smart bombs didn't hit their targets (and we know they did), or they were targeting civilian targets (!) which is hardly condusive to destroying iraq's military potential.  the military mission planners are not fools, they know they have to hit *military* targets to win a war. hitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you, not a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their tyrant-dictator.   how about all the innocent people who died in blanket-bombing in ww2? i don't hear you bemoaning them!  war is never an exact science, but with smart bombs, it's becoming more exact with a smaller percentage of civilian casualties.  sometimes mistakes are made; targets are misidentified; innocents die.  that's war the way it really is. but the alternative, to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth like it's one big rummage sale, grabbing everything they can get is worse.  like patrick henry said some 217 years ago, ""i know not what course others may take -- but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death!""  war is always the price one must be willing to pay if one wishes to stay free.      mathew, your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off-base here. you come off sounding like a complete peace-nik idiot, although i feel sure that was not your intent.  so the iraqi war was wrong, eh?  i'm sure that appeasement would have worked better than war, just like it did in ww2, eh?  i guess we shouldn't have fought ww2 either -- just think of all those innocent german civilians killed in dresden and hamburg.  how about all the poor  french who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent?  we  should have just let hitler take over europe, and you'd be speaking german instead of english right now.  tyrants like hussein *have* to be stopped.  his kind don't understand diplomacy; they only understand the point of a gun.  my only regret is that bush wimped out and didn't have the military roll into baghdad, so now hussein is still in power and the iraqi people's sacrifice (not to mention the 357 americans who died) was for naught.  liberating kuwait  was a good thing, but wiping hussein off the map would've been better!  and as for poor, poor rodney king!  did you ever stop and think *why* the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of ""not guilty""? those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape. but the jury looked at *all* the evidence, evidence which you and i have not seen.  when one makes a judgment without the benefit of a trial where evidence can be presented on both sides, one has simply lowered himself to the level of vigilante justice, a state-of-mind which your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against, but instead tends to support in the case against the policemen.    law in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused, whether they be criminals or cops.  one is not found guilty if there is a reasonable doubt of one's guilt, and only the jury is in a position to assess the evidence and render a verdict.  anyone else is simply succumbing to verbal vigilantism.         regards,",0,alt.atheism

"i have the following problem on x11r5 servers.  when a window of my is obscured by a pop up window which has the save under attribute set, the subwindows of my window are not restored.  normally, the subwindows are redrawn when the parent window gets an expose event, but because the save under attribute is used for the pop up window that obscured my window, no expose event is sent.  when exposuremask is set for the child windows, those windows are correctly updated when the popup window disappears, however then the application gets too many expose events and you see extra redraws.  everything works fine with x11r4.  is this something that is changed between x11r4 and x11r5 (obvious)? is it something i do wrong? is there something that the popup window should do (which is also mine)? is this a bug in x11 release 5?  greetings, --",5,comp.windows.x

"from: center for policy research <cpr> subject: unconventional peace proposal   a unconventional proposal for peace in the middle-east. ---------------------------------------------------------- by 			  elias davidsson  the following proposal is based on the following assumptions:  1.      fundamental human rights, such as the right to life, to education, to establish a family and have children, to human dignity, the right to free movement, to free expression, etc. are more important to human existence that the rights of states.  2.      in the event of a conflict between basic human rights and rights of collectivities, basic human rights should prevail.  3.      between the collectivities defining themselves as jewish-israeli and palestinian-arab, however labelled, an unresolved conflict exists.  4.      this conflict has caused great sufferings for millions of people. it moreover poisons relations between communities, peoples and nations.  5.      each year, the united states expends billions of dollars in economic and military aid to the conflicting parties.  6.      attempts to solve the israeli-arab conflict by traditional political means have failed.  7.      as long as the conflict is perceived as that between two distinct ethnical/religious communities/peoples which claim the land, there is no just nor peaceful solution possible.  8.      love between human beings can be capitalized for the sake of peace and justice. when people love, they share.  having stated my assumptions, i will now state my proposal.  1.      a fund should be established which would disburse grants for each child born to a couple where one partner is israeli-jew and the other palestinian-arab.  2.      to be entitled for a grant, a couple will have to prove that one of the partners possesses or is entitled to israeli citizenship under the law of return and the other partner, although born in areas under current isreali control, is not entitled to such citizenship under the law of return.  3.      for the first child, the grant will amount to $18.000. for the second the third child, $12.000 for each child. for each subsequent child, the grant will amount to $6.000 for each child.   4.      the fund would be financed by a variety of sources which have shown interest in promoting a peaceful solution to the israeli-arab conflict, including the u.s. government, jewish and christian organizations in the u.s.  and a great number of governments and international organizations.  5.      the emergence of a considerable number of 'mixed' marriages in israel/palestine, all of whom would have relatives on 'both sides' of the divide, would make the conflict lose its ethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a truly civil society. the existence of a strong 'mixed' stock of people would also help the integration of israeli society into the middle-east in a graceful manner.  objections to this proposal will certainly be voiced. i will attempt to identify some of these:  1.      the idea of providing financial incentives to selected forms of partnership and marriage, is not conventional. however, it is based on the concept of affirmative action, which is recognized as a legitimate form of public policy to reverse the perverse effects of segregation and discrimination. international law clearly permits affirmative action when it is aimed at reducing racial discrimination and segregation.  2.      it may be objected that the israeli-palestinian conflict is not primarily a religious or ethnical conflict, but that it is a conflict between a colonialist settler society and an indigenous colonized society that can only regain its freedom by armed struggle. this objection is based on the assumption that the 'enemy' is not zionism as ideology and practice, but israeli-jewish society and its members which will have to be defeated. this objection has no merit because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions concerning the primacy of fundamental human rights over collective rights (see above)  3.      fundamentalist jews would certainly object to the use of financial incentives to encourage 'mixed marriages'. from their point of view, the continued existence of a specific jewish people overrides any other consideration, be it human love, peace of human rights.  the president of the world jewish congress, edgar bronfman, reflected this view a few years ago in an interview he gave to der spiegel, a german magazine. he called the increasing assimilation of jews in the world a <calamity>, comparable in its effects only with the holocaust. this objection has no merit either because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions (see above)  4.      it may objected that only a few people in israel/palestine, would request such grants and that it would thus not serve its purpose. to this objection one might respond that although it is not possible to determine with certainty the effect of such a proposal, the existence of such a fund would help mixed couples to resist the pressure of their respective societies and encourage young couples to reject fundamentalist and racist attitudes.  5.      it may objected that such a fund would need great sums to bring about substantial demographic changes. this objection has merits. however, it must be remembered that huge sums, more than $3 billion, are expended each year by the united states government and by u.s. organizations to maintain an elusive peace in the middle-east through armaments. a mere fraction of these sums would suffice to launch the above proposal and create a more favorable climate towards the existence of 'mixed' marriages in israel/palestine, thus encouraging the emergence of a non-segregated society in that worn-torn land.  i would be thankful for critical comments to the above proposal as well for any dissemination of this proposal for meaningful discussion and enrichment.",17,talk.politics.mideast

"yes, this is also my understanding of the majority of islamic laws. however, i believe there are also certain legal rulings which, in all five schools of law (4 sunni and 1 jaffari), can be levelled against muslim or non-muslims, both within and outside dar-al-islam. i do not know if apostasy (when accompanied by active, persistent, and open hostility to islam) falls into this category of the law. i do know that historically, apostasy has very rarely been punished at all, let alone by the death penalty.  my understanding is that khomeini's ruling was not based on the law of apostasy (alone). it was well known that rushdie was an apostate long before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no precedent in the qur'an, hadith, or in islamic history for indiscriminantly levelling death penalties for apostasy.  i believe the charge levelled against rushdie was that of ""fasad"". this ruling applies both within and outside the domain of an islamic state and it can be carried out by individuals. the reward was not offered by khomeini but by individuals within iran.   i would concur that the thrust of the fatwa (from what i remember) was levelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication of the book. however, the charge of ""fasad"" can encompass a number of lesser charges. i remember that when diplomatic relations broke off between britain and iran over the fatwa - iran stressed that the condemnation of the author, and the removal of the book from circulation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the ""crisis"". but you are correct to point out that banning the book was not the main thrust behind the fatwa. islamic charges such as fasad are levelled at people, not books.  the rushdie situation was followed in iran for several months before the issuance of the fatwa. rushdie went on a media blitz, presenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of secular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people crazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred.  fanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost his image and push the book, he was everywhere in the media. then muslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while protesting against the book. rushdie appeared momentarily concerned, then climbed back on his media horse to once again attack the muslims and defend his sacred rights. it was at this point that the fatwa on ""fasad"" was issued.  the fatwa was levelled at the person of rushdie - any actions of rushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of the ruling. the book remains in circulation not by some independant will of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. the fatwa against the person of rushdie encompasses his actions as well. the crime was certainly a crime in progress (at many levels) and was being played out (and played up) in the the full view of the media.",0,alt.atheism

"peter nelson posted a very eloquent response to this point in  talk.politics.misc, so i need not consume more bandwidth here.    what i meant, if it was not clear, was the intersection set of liberal and libertarian philosophies of ""natural rights"" and how the government (and constitutional interpretation in particular) fits into that  philosophy.  this philosophy engages in the very serious practical  error of endowing the nine lawyers on the supreme court with an almost  totalitarian authority, completely outside of the consent or consensus  of the people.  this is why supreme court nominations are such amazing political fist-fights these days, because he who controls the court rules the country.  the people on the court may well be trying to do the best job they can, but they are at best a benevolent oligarch, even if you approve of every supreme court decision ever.  eventually, an oligarch will arise that will decimate that which you hold dear.  try  supreme court cases by jury, and the problem would be mitigated a great  deal.  those who would create broad, non-enumerated government powers at any  level (as in european parlamentary democracies and the current de-facto standard in the u.s.) have essentially engaged in the same fundamental  mistake, except that it is some different body that has the totalitarian,  virtually unchecked (except by plurality election, death, or retirement),  government power.     this is like asking why the wind blows, unless you can prove that the fact of your engaging in certain activities has absolutely no  effect whatsoever on any other human being who has not consented to your engagement in those activities.  very few human activities indeed fit into this category.    even for those few that do, who would you empower to make the judgement  of what is and is not a fully autonomous activity?  who defines ""picking  my pocket"" and ""defrauding""?  are economic assets a person's only assets, or are peace of mind, stability, confidence in a child's emotional  environment, security, and many other things not also a part of a person's assets?  what gives you the right to create a moral environment that a parent strongly objects to?  what gives you the right to create an  environment of social unrest and instability?  if you say that what you do does not have those effects, by what authority do you say that?  who is empowered to make these value judgements?    if the federal constitution explicitly prohibited you from doing so, the  federal government would prevent you from doing so.  if it did not, and you could muster enough local support to pass an amendment to the local constitution (by, say, a 3/4 majority) empowering the local government  to do so, then i would have to vote with my feet and move to a neighborhood more friendly to my own system of values.  this is not an ideal situation, but it is far better than the mess we are mired in right now.    when you define ""rights"" very broadly, there is no practical choice about  whether people will or will not infringe upon your rights since these ""rights"" overlap.  even when rights are defined very narrowly, the government  has been empowered to prevent others from infringing on your rights.  the  fundamental question is, by whose authority is that power created.  if you  support the current situation with a ""natural rights"" supreme court (rather than an ""original understanding"" supreme court or, even better, supreme court by jury), you are consenting to having nine lawyers in washington,  d.c. create those powers out of the air.  in my ""fractal federalism"" scenario,  it is a broad consensus of the people (i.e. the amendment process) that  creates those powers.    no, i mean the federal government that comes trucking in with guns to tell the locals how to run their neighborhood.  waco, tx is a nice example.    if you create a community where public masturbation is permitted in the  cause of ""personal autonomy"", have you done anything different?  what precisely are these autonomous activities you are referring to?  if you list them, perhaps we can get enough people to agree that they are truly autonomous and pass a constitutional amendment protecting them.     the koresh incident appears to be a horrendous abuse of government power, power possibly illegitimately obtained through a means i would abolish.  the constitutionality of ""no-knock"" warrants seems very dubious to me, not to mention the mere existence of batf and the government's propensity to  ignore the word ""infringe"" in the second amendment.  this power is upheld  by the same body, with its incredible concentration of power in the hands  of nine people, that has upheld much so-called ""civil rights"" (read- affirmative  action) legislation despite the fourteenth amendment.    money is certainly not the only asset i have in this world.  if it were, this would be a bleak existence indeed.     matt freivald   -------------------------------------------------------------------------- liborgalism:              thinking is irrelevant. integrity is irrelevant.           free speech is irrelevant. private property is irrelevant.                  personal responsibility is irrelevant.                      conservativism is futile.                       you will be assimilated. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- these are my opinions only and not those of my employer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",18,talk.politics.misc

"archive-name: ripem/attacks last-update: 31 mar 93 21:00:00 -0500  some possible attacks on ripem ------------------------------  this is a living list of potential weaknesses to keep your eyes open for when using ripem for secure electronic mail.  it does not go into great detail, and is almost certainly not exhaustive.  obviously, many of the weaknesses are weaknesses of cryptographically secured mail in general, and will pertain to secure mail programs other than ripem. it is maintained by marc vanheyningen <mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu>.  it is posted monthly to a variety of news groups; followups pertaining specifically to ripem should go to alt.security.ripem.  cryptanalysis attacks ---------------------  - breaking rsa would allow an attacker to find out your private key,   in which case he could read any mail encrypted to you and sign   messages with your private key.    rsa is generally believed to be resistant to all standard   cryptanalytic techniques.  even a standard key (about 516 bits with   ripem) is long enough to render this impractical, barring a   huge investment in hardware or a breakthrough in factoring.  - breaking des would allow an attacker to read any given message,   since the message itself is encrypted with des.  it would not allow   an attacker to claim to be you.    des has only 56 bits in its key, and thus could conceivably be   compromised by brute force with sufficient hardware, but few agencies   have such money to devote to simply read one message.  since each   message has a different des key, the work for each message would   remain high.  key management attacks ----------------------  - stealing your private key would allow the same benefits as breaking   rsa.  to safeguard it, it is encrypted with a des key which is derived   from a passphrase you type in.  however, if an attacker can get a copy   of your private keyfile and your passphrase (by snooping network   packets, tapping lines, or whatever) he could break the whole scheme.    the main risk is that of transferring either the passphrase or the   private key file across an untrusted link.  so don't do that.  run    ripem on a trusted machine, preferably one sitting right in front of   you.  ideally, your own machine in your own home (or maybe office)   which nobody else has physical access to.  - fooling you into accepting a bogus public key for someone else could    allow an opponent to deceive you into sending secret messages to him   rather than to the real recipient.  if the enemy can fool your   intended recipient as well, he could re-encrypt the messages with   the other bogus public key and pass them along.    it is important to get the proper public keys of other people.   the most common mechanism for this is finger; assuming the opponent   has not compromised routers or daemons or such, finger can be    given a fair amount of trust.  the strongest method of key   authentication is to exchange keys in person; however, this is   not always practical.  having other people ""vouch for you"" by   signing a statement containing your key is possible, although    ripem doesn't have features for doing this as automatically as   pgp.  ripem does generate and check md5 fingerprints of public keys   in the key files; they may be exchanged via a separate channel for   authentication.  playback attacks ----------------  - even if an opponent cannot break the cryptography, an opponent could   still cause difficulties.  for example, suppose you send a message   with mic-only (a pem mode which does not provide disclosure protection)   to alice which says ""ok, let's do that."" your opponent intercepts   it, and now resends it to bob, who now has a message which is   authenticated as from you telling him to do that.  of course, he may   interpret it in an entirely different context.  or your opponent   could transmit the same message to the same recipient much later,   figuring it would be seen differently at a later time.  or the   opponent could change the originator-name: to himself, register    your public key as his, and send a message hoping the recipient   will send him return mail indicating (perhaps even quoting!) the   unknown message.    to defeat playback attacks, the plaintext of each message should    include some indication of the sender and recipient, and a unique   identifier (typically the date).  a good front-end script for ripem   should do this automatically (imho).  as a recipient, you should be   sure that the originator-name: header and the sender indicated within   the plaintext are the same, that you really are a recipient, and that   the message is not an old one.  some this also can and should be   automated.  the author of this faq has made a modest attempt at   automating the process of generating and checking encapsulated   headers; the programs are included in the standard distribution in   the utils directory.  local attacks -------------  - clearly, the security of ripem cannot be greater than the security of   the machine where the encryption is performed.  for example, under   unix, a super-user could manage to get at your encrypted mail,   although it would take some planning and effort to do something like   replace the ripem executable with a trojan horse or to get a copy of   the plaintext, depending how it's stored.    in addition, the link between you and the machine running ripem is   an extension of that.  if you decrypt with ripem on a remote machine   which you are connected to via network (or, worse yet, modem), an   eavesdropper could see the plaintext (and probably also your   passphrase.)    ripem should only be executed on systems you trust, obviously.  in   the extreme case, ripem should only be used on your own machine,   which you have total control over and which nobody else has access   to, which has only carefully examined software known to be free of   viruses, and so on.  however, there's a very real trade-off between   convenience and security here.    a more moderately cautious user might use ripem on a unix workstation   where other people have access (even root access), but increase   security by keeping private keys and the (statically linked, of   course) executable on a floppy disk.    some people will keep ripem on a multi-user system, but when dialing   in over an insecure line, they will download the message to their   own system and perform the ripem decryption there.  however, the   security provided by such a mechanism is somewhat illusory; since   you presumably type your cleartext password to log in, you've just   given away the store, since the attacker can now log in as you and   install traps in your account to steal your private key next time   you use it from a less insecure line.  this will likely remain the   situation as long as most systems use the rather quaint mechanism of   cleartext password authentication.    i find it nice to put a brief statement of how carefully i manage my   security arrangement in my .plan next to my public key, so that   potential correspondents can be aware what level of precautions are   in place.  some people use two keys, a short one which is not   carefully managed for ordinary use and a longer one which is treated   with greater care for critical correspondence.  untrusted partner attacks -------------------------  - ripem's encryption will ensure that only a person with the private key   corresponding to the public key used to encrypt the data may read the   traffic.  however, once someone with that key gets the message, she   may always make whatever kind of transformations she wishes.  there    exist no cryptographic barriers to a recipient, say, taking an   encrypted message and converting it to a mic-only message, signed by   you and readable by anyone, although ripem does not provide this   functionality.  indeed, the latest pem draft i have seen specifically   states that such transformations should be possible to allow   forwarding functions to work.",11,sci.crypt

""why?"" ""because they're burning the city and killing the armenians. there isn't an armenian left."" well i got hold of myself so i could still stand up. so we squared it away, the four of us got in the car, and we  set off for sumgait. on the way the driver says, ""in fact there aren't any armenians left. 'they burned them all, beat them all, and stabbed them."" well  i was silent. the whole way--20-odd miles--i was silent. the driver asks me,  ""how old are you, old man?"" he wants to know: if i'm being that quiet, not  saying anything, maybe it means i'm an armenian. ""how old are you?"" he asks  me. i say, ""i'm 47."" ""i'm 47 too, but i call you 'old man'."" i say, ""it  depends on god, each person's life in this world is different."" i look much older than my years, that's why he called me old man. well after that he was silent, too.  we're approaching the city, i look and see tanks all around, and a cordon. before we get to the kavkaz store the driver starts to wave his hand. well, he was waving his hand, we all start waving our hands. i'm sitting there with them, i start waving my hand, too. i realized that this was a sign that meant there were no armenians with us.  i look at the city--there is a crowd of people walking down the middle of the  street, you know, and there's no traffic. well probably i was scared. they stopped our car. people were standing on the sidewalks. they have armature  shafts, and stones . . . and they stopped us . . .  along the way the driver tells us how they know who's an armenian and who's  not. the armenians usually . . . for example, i'm an armenian, but i speak  their language very well. well armenians usually pronounce the azeri word for  ""nut,"" or ""little nut,"" as ""pundukh,"" but ""fundukh"" is actually correct. the  pronunciations are different. anyone who says ""pundukh,"" even if they're not  armenian, they immediately take out and start to slash. another one says,  ""there was a car there, with five people inside it,"" he says. ""they started  hitting the side of it with an axe and lit it on fire. and they didn't let the people out,"" he says, ""they wouldn't let them get out of the car."" i only saw  the car, but the driver says that he saw everything. well he often drives from baku to sumgait and back . . .  when they stop us we all get out of the car. i look and there's a short guy, his eyes are gleaming, he has an armature shaft in one hand and a stone in the other and asks the guys what nationality they are one by one. ""we're azerbaijani,' they tell him, 'no armenians here."" he did come up to me when  we were pulling our things out and says, ""maybe you're an armenian, old man?""  but in azerbaijani i say, ""you should be ashamed of yourself!"" and . . . he  left. turned and left. that was all that happened. what was i to do? i had  to . . . the city was on fire, but i had to steal my children out of my own  home.  they stopped us at the entrance to mir street, that's where the kavkaz store  and three large, 12-story buildings are. that's the beginning of down-town. i  saw that burned automobile there, completely burned, only metal remained. i  couldn't figure out if it was a zhiguli or a zaporozhets. later i was told it  was a zhiguli. and the people in there were completely incinerated. nothing  remained of them, not even any traces. that driver had told me about it, and i saw the car myself. the car was there. the skeleton, a metallic carcass. about 30 to 40 yards from the kavkaz store.  i see a military transport, an armored personnel carrier. the hatches are closed. and people are throwing armature shafts and pieces of iron at it, the crowd is. and i hear shots, not automatic fire, it's true, but pistol shots. several shots. there were azerbaijanis crowded around that personnel carrier.  someone in the crowd was shooting. apparently they either wanted to kill the  soldiers or get a machine gun or something. at that point there was only one  armored personnel carrier. and all the tanks were outside the city, cordoning  off sumgait.  i walked on. i see two azerbaijanis going home from the plant. i can tell by  their gait that they're not bandits, they're just people, walking home. i joined them so in case something happened, in case someone came up to us and asked questions, either of us would be in a position to answer, you see. but i avoided the large groups because i'm a local and might be quickly  recognized. i tried to keep at a distance, and walked where there were fewer people. well so i walked into microdistrict 2, which is across from our block. i can't get into our block, but i walked where there were fewer people, so as  to get around. well there i see a tall guy and 25 to 30 people are walking  behind him. and he's shouting into a megaphone: ""comrades, the armenian- azerbaijani war has begun!""  the police have megaphones like that. so they're talking and walking around  the second microdistrict. i see that they're coming my way, and turn off  behind a building. i noticed that they walked around the outside buildings,  and inside the microdistricts there were about 5 or 6 people standing on every corner, and at the middles of the buildings, and at the edges. what they were  doing i can't say, because i couldn't get up close to them, i was afraid. but  the most important thing was to get away from there, to get home, and at least find out if my children were alive or not . . .     april 20, 1988    yerevan  		     - - - reference - - -  [1] _the sumgait tragedy; pogroms against armenians in soviet azerbaijan,     volume i, eyewitness accounts_, edited by samuel shahmuradian, forward by     yelena bonner, 1990, published by aristide d. caratzas, ny, pages 158-160",17,talk.politics.mideast

"we here at ibm have the same problem with our workstations.  i was also shocked when i first realized that you have to offset lines from fills by about 16 bits (assuming 24 bit z buffer).  this seems huge, but is only 1/256 of the dynamic range.  in those terms it doesn't seem so bad.  what is happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear, due mainly to roundoff, i believe.  so the polygon is not planar in z, but is more like a ruffles potato chip.  ditto with lines.  when you start/end at different x/y values, the ""ridges"" are out of phase, resulting in the stitch effect.  you have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygon right on top of another, but with different vertices.  you will likely see a smeared effect where they overlap.   example:   try polygon 1: (100,100,100) (100,200,100) (200,200,100) (200,100,100)       polygon 2: (125,125,100) (125,175,100) (175,175,100) (175,125,100)  your implementation is correct.  in fact, we do a similar trick when rendering primitives that have lines and polygons - such as nurbs surfaces with isoparametric lines.  without the trick, the lines appear stitched, as you say.  when the application draws lines/polygons independently, the system does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting, so the application must do it.  this is what you have discovered and are doing. bravo!

"[patrick's example of anti-competitive regulations for             auto dealers deleted.]  let me try to drag this discussion back to the original issues.  as i've noted before, i'm not necessarily disputing the benefits of  eliminating anti-competitive legislation with regard to auto dealers, barbers, etc.  one need not, however, swallow the entire libertarian agenda to accomplish this end.  just because one grants the benefits of allowing anyone who wishes to cut hair to sell his/her services without regulation does not mean that the same unregulated barbers should be  free to bleed people as a medical service without government intervention.   (as some/many libertarians would argue.)    on a case by case basis, the cost/benefit ratio of government regulation is obviously worthwhile.  the libertarian agenda, however, does not call for this assessment.  it assumes that the costs of regulation (of any kind) always outweigh its benefits.  this approach avoids all sorts of  difficult analysis, but it strikes many of the rest of us as dogmatic,  to say the least.  i have no objection to an analysis of medical care, education,  national defense or local police that suggests a ""free market"" can provide a more effective, efficient means of accomplishing social objectives than is provided through ""statist"" approaches.   with some notable exceptions, however, i do not see such nitty-gritty, worthwhile  analysis being carried out by self-professed libertarians.    jsh",18,talk.politics.misc

"yes, it's important to realize that all actions have consequences, and that ""rules"" were made for our own good.  but to suggest that a *disease* is a *punishment* for certain types of sin i think is  taking things much too far.  if we got some kind of mouth disease for lying, would any of us have mouths left?  what if we developed blindness every time we lusted after someone or something?  i dare say all of us would be walking into walls.  yes, sin can have terrible consequences, but we need to be *real* careful when saying that the consequences are a *punishment* for  sin.  the jews of jesus's time believed that all sickness was the result of a sin.  then jesus healed a blind man and said that man was blind to show the glory of god, not because of sin.  if aids, or any other std is a *punishment"" for sexual sin, what do we do with  diseases like cancer, or multiple sclerosis, which are just as debilitating and terrible as aids, yet are not usually linked to a specific behavior or lifestyle?  atonement is *extremely* important, but i think you've missed the mark about as far as you can by suggesting that aids is an atonement for sin. the atonement for sin is jesus christ - period.  this is the central message of the gospel.  a perfect sacrifice was required for our sins, and was made in the lamb of god.  his sacrifice atoned for *all* of our sins, past present and future.  god does not require pennance for our sins, nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement.  he has graciously already done that for us.  to suggest that aids or  some other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spitting on the sacrifice that jesus made.  in case you couldn't tell, i get *extremely* angry and upset when i see things like this.  instead of rationalizing our own fears and phobias, we need to be reaching out to people with aids and other socially unacceptable diseases.  whether they got the disease through their own actions or not is irrelevant.  they still need jesus christ, no more and no less than we do.  i've said this before, but i think it's a good analogy.  people with aids are modern-day lepers.  jesus healed many lepers.  he can also heal people with aids, maybe not on this earth, but in an ultimate sense.  my next-door neighbor has aids. she has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed  relationship with god.  her theology isn't what i would want it to be, but god's grace covers her.  the amazing thing is that she is gaining weight (she's had the disease for over 2 years) and her health is excellent apart from occassional skin rashes and such.  she attributes her improvement in her health to god's intervention in her life.  who are we to suggest that her disease is some kind of punishment?  it seems to me that god is being glorified through her disease.  paul overstreet, the country singer, has a good song title that i  think applies to all of us - but for the grace of god, there go i (or something like that).  may we all experience and accept god's grace.   =============================================================================== paul conditt		internet: conditt@titan.tsd.arlut.utexas.edu applied research	phone:	  (512) 835-3422   fax: (512) 835-3416/3259   laboratories		fedex:	  10000 burnet road, austin, texas 78758-4423 university of texas	postal:	  p.o. box 8029, austin, texas 78713-8029 austin, texas <----- the most wonderful place in texas to live",15,soc.religion.christian

  baku (may 19) turan: yesterday, rasul guliyev, the recently appointed vice-premier of the republic, received the us ambassador in azerbaijan, richard miles. as ""azerbaijan"" newspaper informs, the issue of attraction of western investments in azerbaijan was discussed in the meeting. in particular, gulyiev stated that western capital has to be investigated in the most profitable spheres of manufacture. he also noticed, that the number of the priority manufactures will be released from debts.  guliyev also said that intensifying the activities of the american oil  companies will promote the strengthening of the american-azeri relations.   the proposal to summon special session of the supreme soviet is rejected again     baku (may 19) turan: yesterday, in the sitting of the milli mejlis, the chairman, isa gambar, rejected the proposal of the deputy arif rahimzade to summon a special session of the supreme soviet of azerbaijan.   this written proposal to summon a session was signed by 130 deputates. but the chairman said that the signatures were invalid and the proposal couldn't be submitted for discussion.    earlier, the leadership of the milli mejlis called the proposal to summon a special session of the supreme soviet a coup attempt. but the deputy for the parliament, rahimzade, doesn't consider that the deputates have the  objective of removing milli mejlis and its chairman from the power. it concerns the serious analysis of the social, economic and foreign policy activity of the republic's authority. rahimzade said that the deputates for the parliament, ejected from their duties one year ago have the rights to express their opinion on these questions.    the supreme soviet of azerbaijan (340 deputates) was dissolved one year ago, when it attempted to bring ayaz mutalibov back to the power.    the functions of s.s. were handed over to milli mejlis, consisting of 50 deputates (25 ""democrats"" and 25 ""partocrates""). at that time ""democrats"" and ""partocrates"" came to an agreement that milli mejlis wouldn't exist for a long  time and would be dissolved after parliamentary elections. at the same time, the deputates ejected from their duties were guaranteed that they could summon a session of the supreme soviet any time and went in for political activity out of the parliament. --0--   the prospects of trade/economic cooperation between azerbaijan and estonia      baku (may 19) turan: the prospects of signing trade-economic agreement between azerbaijan and estonia were discussed in the meeting of the foreign  minister tofig gasimov with the group of experts of the ministry of economics, minister of foreign affairs and estonian bank administration on may 18.  the group of experts is headed by tikht reiman, the chief of the ministry of economics of estonia.    the mia of azerbaijan informed turan agency, that in their stay in baku, the delegation will also visit ministry of economics and national bank of the republic.--0--   azerbaijan does not intend to join the cis common economic zone     baku (may 19) turan: deputy prime-ministers of the republic, vahid ahmedov and abbas abbasov declared that azerbaijan wouldn't join the cis common economic zone.    vahid ahmedov considers that the cis economic zone proposal to create a  common tax system contradicts independent economic policy of the republic.  according to abbas abbasov, the pact of cooperation proposals, submitted for the discussion of the leaders of cis states in moscow on may 14, has a number of unfavorable points for azerbaijan.    such announcements of two deputy prime-ministers sound sensational on the background of the fact that the president of azerbaijan and the chairman of the parliament noted the necessity of the republic on joining the cis economic zone.--0--   the questions of granting credit to azerbaijan will be discussed in moscow       baku (may 19) turan: today, azerbaijani delegation headed by the director of the foreign relation department of the ministry of finance of the republic along with the representatives of the national bank will leave for moscow to hold consultation with russian government on granting credit to azerbaijan.  according to the preliminary information, the credit will be 50 billion rubles.     as press-centre of ministry of finance informed turan's correspondent,  precise amount of the credit, conditions of its repay and a number of other questions of mutual interest will be discussed in the course of the meeting in moscow. it is known that this credit will be mostly used for mutual settling of industrial enterprises of azerbaijan and russia.     when the sides reach the agreement, it is proposed for signing by the end  of may.--0--   azerbaijan will reply to the second variant of trilateral initiative by 26 of may       baku (may 19) turan: on the measures for peace presented by russia, turkey and the usa to azerbaijan and armenia, the representative of the president of azerbaijan in the talks on nagorno-karabakh, asim gasimov noted that the plan was not seriously changed in comparison with the first variant.      ""just some comments to several points were added to the schedule by  insistence of the armenian side. we do not intend to come back to the analysis of the schedule, because we have given a positive answer to it on may 6"",- said gasimov.      the representative of the president of azerbaijan informed that they just began to work on the examination of the commentary, and their answer would be  given as requested by the authors of trilateral initiative by may 26.      as it is known, the first variant of the peace measures was rejected by armenia, which put forward a number of pre-conditions for its acceptance.--0--   the announcement of the prosecutor of the republic of azerbaijan     baku (may 20) turan: the azerbaijani prosecutor's office has announced that the russian mass media's attempt to portray the 6 russian soldiers  condemned by the military board of the azerbaijani supreme court, as innocent people is unjustified.     accounts of the witnesses and the confessions of the condemned themselves, prove that their crimes were committed together with the armenian military units and with the knowledge of the headquarters of the russian army unit, where they served.     the announcement points out that the attempts to represent these soldiers as ordinary mercenaries who have nothing to do with the russian army are also  unfounded. for there are irrefutable evidences that these soldiers were on the list of one of the military unit's of russian commandos in yerevan.    certain russian circles try to conceal the fact of direct participation of the russian army in the undeclared war of armenia against azerbaijan from the russian community. azerbaijan's prosecutor's announcement follows, that this type of actions can make the situation in the region much more complicated.--0--   azerbaijan's parliament intends to appeal to russian parliament regarding the six accused soldiers       baku (may 20) turan: as turan agency was informed, parliament of azerbaijan is considering the question of appealing to russian parliament about the six accused soldiers' fortune. in particular, the offer to send the representatives of the commission on military affairs of the armed forces of russian federation to baku for the detailed study of the results of six russian soldiers' case will be directed to russian parliament.      according to one of the supporters of this offer, such initiative will give russian parliament the possibility to be convinced of the correctness of the investigation. there will also be a chance to discuss the reasons that have given rise to the present situation - that is the russian troops participation in the war against azerbaijan.   armenians are preparing more ""karabakhs"" on the north caucasus       baku (may 20) turan: the national-liberation front founded by group of  armenians living on the north caucasus appealed to establish armenian autonomies on the territories of rostov, stavropol and krasnodar regions, - reported the newspaper ""russky vestnik"" on march 9, 1993 published in geneva.      the north caucasus is regarded as an integral part of armenia in the  documents of this organization. admitting the non-realizability of ""reunion"" of the north caucasus and ""armenia proper"" at present, the front is appealing to  the un, presidents of russia, armenia and the united states to consider the need to establish armenian autonomies on the caucasus.      to attain these goals, the armenian organization considers it necessary to carry out on the north caucasus the forms and methods of activity ""identical to those in nagorno karabakh"". besides the decision to fund cells of armenian national-liberation fronts in every settlement and to appeal to leaders of armenian terrorist groups in greece and iran to sent to the north caucasus  instructors for training of armenian youth to wage secret wars was adopted.      thus according to the newspaper ""russky vestnik"", ""new karabakhs"" are  being planning on the north caucasus. --o--   state assistance for national minority development       baku (may 20) turan: the meeting headed by the state secretary of azerbaijan, ali kerimov, with the participation of the national cultural centers was held in baku. the first results of the realization of the president elchibey's decree on state assistance for the development of language and culture of national minorities adopted on september 16, 1992 were considered.       the state secretary called this decree as an important step to establish a legal democratic state. he confirmed once more the commitment of the leadership of azerbaijan to set up a democratic society in which the rights of all  nationalities and ethnic groups would be respected.      the state counsellor of the president of azerbaijan on the national policy, hidayat orujev, announced that in spite of the difficulties of the ""undeclared war"" against the republic, the leaders of the state managed to solve many  problems concerning the satisfaction of cultural and other needs of the ethnic groups.       for today, all 33 national-cultural centers registered by the ministry of justice in the capital of azerbaijan are provided with accommodation, furniture  and means of communication. all the accommodations are rent-free ( 8 foreign diplomatic missions in baku are placed in the hotels because of the absence of free accommodations including the representation of the un general secretary).       as it was noted, a great work was carried out since the decree was adopted to create conditions for total development of the ethnic groups. on the north of azerbaijan where lezghins live, a national lezghin theater was opened,  radiocast is transmitted in lezghin. the work over the creation of the educational literature for talyshs, tats, lezghins and kurds and national teaching and scientific staff is being carried out in the academy of sciences of azerbaijan.--o--    memorandum of cooperation on extracting oil-gas fields of azerbaijan was signed       baku (may 20) turan: as turan agency was informed in the state  concern ""azerineft"", the memorandum of understanding with the companies ""amoco caspian sea petroleum"", ""bi-pi exploration operating"", ""pennzoil caspian"", ""unocal khazar ltd."", ""mcdermott"" and turkish oil corporation on mutual extracting of fields ""azeri"", ""chirag"" and ""gyuneshli"" was signed.  according to the memorandum, the general group on preparing of a common program of activity was created.       according to the president of ""azerineft"", sabit bagirov, cooperation will provide for using the experience of foreign companies more efficiently.       during the project, the main principles will be the effective use of oil-gas resources, the rational sharing of investments, the reducing of exploitation expenditures and maximizing the profit of azerbaijan from the exploitation of these fields.  the memorandum also envisions the necessity to take into account the historical and political-economical interests of azerbaijan under optimum use of oil-gas fields. --o--   armenia taking advantage of the prosecution of six russian soldiers       baku (may 21) turan: after azerbaijani court passed sentence on  six russian soldiers fighting on the armenian side in karabakh, armenian propaganda has become actively involved.      the armenians living in russia appealed to the president yeltsin with a request ""to display firmness in asserting the rights of russian soldiers"". at the same time, armenian mass media call legal proceedings on the case in baku as ""a farce aimed at getting more arms from russia"".      the karabakh armenians have issued a threat recently. if one could believe the yerevan agency ""snark"", the armenians in karabakh presented an ultimatum to authorities in azerbaijan. the essence of this ultimatum is that if russian soldiers are not shown mercy, three azeri prisoners in karabakh will be shot dead.      it is simple to explain such ""touching attitude of armenians"" to the six russian soldiers' fate. if by chance the sentence is executed it will cause not anti-azeri but anti-armenian reaction, as the accused russian soldiers were recruited in yerevan by the former defence minister of armenia and then transferred to karabakh.      if the soldiers get mercy, armenian side will think highly of its saving of lives of ""innocent russians"". --o--   new provocations of armed forces of armenia       baku (may 21) turan: according to the defence ministry of azerbaijan on may 20-21, the firing on the territories of azerbaijan from the military bases on the territory of armenia was in progress.      the day before, the villages of kolly-gyshlag, shotaraz, nyachaflar of zangelan district of azerbaijan were under fire from kafan district of armenia. two inhabitants were wounded, there were destructions in the villages.      on may 20, the firing on the villages of bashkend, mutudere, shynykh, novosaratovka and novoivanovka of kedabek district of azerbaijan from the positions of armenian armed forces was in progress.      at the same day the diversion group of the armed forces of armenia (50-60 men) violated the frontier of azerbaijan, penetrated into the territory of kedabek district of azerbaijan, killed two shepherds at the village of aili-dara and made an attempt to take a flock across the frontier. azeri frontier-guards stopped the enemy.--o--   ""unocal"" company will build 50 houses for refugees in azerbaijan       baku (may 21) turan: as turan agency was informed by the representation of unocal american oil company, the leaders of this company decided to give 750 thousand dollars for the construction of 50 houses for refugees.      at present, the american side suggested a village project for  consideration by appropriate departments of azerbaijan. the project is a farm village where each house has a personal lot, subsidiary accommodations and so on.      according to the program the construction and putting into operation of the village will be this year. --o--   manat is beginning to fall in value       baku (may 21) turan: lately, at the black market of baku, the national currency - manat, fell in price compared with the russian ruble. thus one gives 1100 rubles or 120 manats for one us dollar. taking into account the official exchange-value of the manat with  respect to ruble which is 1-10, the national currency fell in value 10 percent. meanwhile the exchange-value of the manat to the ruble is the same at banks, state establishments and in trade.      according to the representatives of the business circles and experts, the present situation is explained by the fact that the rubles are bought by the local businessmen. they need rubles for financial operations in russia. as the remittance of payments from the republics of the former ussr to russia is a great problem now, many businessmen arrange deals in cash. taking into consideration the volume of business  with russia, counted by billions, it is not hard to imagine how much  rubles in cash the businessmen need. --o--   the discussion of parliamentary election bill will last till mid july      baku (may 22) turan: according to the president's decree, the expert group, including representatives of the parliament and  presidential apparatus, are working out new wording of the constitution of the republic of azerbaijan. this must be adopted by milli mejlis before the parliamentary elections. together with this, the work on the new constitution, that would be, evidently, adopted by new parliament of the country, is going on. the newsmen were informed about the work on the press-conference of the supreme soviet of the republic the day before.     parliamentary legal experts, safa mirzoyev, simran hasanov and  representatives of the department of the president's apparatus fazil mustafaev and shahin aliev took part in the press-conference.     the national discussion of the project of the parliamentary election law is going on at present. according to simran hasanov the bill didn't cause any objections. it was noted, that until now, no alternative variant of the election law was put forward.    the newsmen were also informed, that parliamentary commissions will examine all coming proposals till june 10. by june 15 all proposals will be generalized and submitted for discussion in milli mejlis.--0--   isa gambar suggests that azeri-russian parliament commission for  clarifying the circumstances of the criminal case be created     baku (may 22) turan: the chairman of the milly mejlis of the azerbaijan republic, isa gambar, sent the return letter to the chairman of the russian supreme soviet ruslan khasbulatov in connection with the conviction of the russian servicemen lieutenant v.semion, sergeant k. tukish, m.lisov and a.filipov by the military college of the supreme court of azerbaijan.    in his letter, isa gambar suggested that the commission of azerbaijan milly mejlis deputates on a par with the experts of the russian supreme soviet be established to clarify the circumstances of this criminal case. in his view, ""the conclusion of the commission could help in the  objective solving of this problem, as well as such kind of problems in the future. but the main thing is, it could help to promote the knowledge about involvement of the russian servicemen in crime"".    in its turn, in connection with the russian parliament message, milly mejlis adopted a resolution on may 19, according to which the permanent commissions on government building and legal policy, human rights and international relations are charged with the exploration of this problem.--0--   will the trilateral initiative be ruined?        baku (may 22) turan: as turan agency was informed, russian representative to the talks on karabakh, vladimir kazimirov, doubted in realization of the  trilateral initiative. he expressed this opinion during a telephone talk with the representatives of azerbaijan. at the same talk he declared, that in case the peace process deadlocked, russia would pursue yeltsin's initiative itself.      such statement from the russian diplomat, who is one of the authors of the trilateral initiative, suggests that the russian leadership is paving the way for complete exclusion of the usa and probably turkey from the peacemaking process. this statement can also mean, that russia and us having achieved understanding on bosnian problem, have agreed on partial us departure from transcaucasia.--0--   fate of 645 million tons of oil will be decided this summer     baku (may 22) turan: the president of azerbaijan state oil company, sabit bagirov, declared recently that complete treaty on development of oil fields chirag, azeri and guneshli would be signed this summer. as it is known, western oil companies amoco, bp-statoil, pennzoil- ramco have an interest on development of these three richest caspian fields.    according to the plan, socar and bp-statoil are to sign a complete treaty on development of chirag field on june 16. later amoco and pennzoil will sign treaties.    specialists value total reserves of these three fields to be 645 million ton. 310 million of them fall on azeri field, 180 mln.ton on geneshli and 150 mln.ton on chirag.    the exploitation of these fields is to last tens of years and it is to bring in azerbaijan 100 billion dollars in revenue. in addition to the net economic profit, baku calculates upon the political support of the west in the defence of its interests at the international scene.    as president elchibey said in his closest encirclement ""the may of 1993 will be one of the most difficult periods for azerbaijan and its independence and we have to stand these tests"".--0--  the scientist-lawyers of russia appealed to the president of azerbaijan     baku (may 22) turan: as the press-service of the president of azerbaijan informs, today, the appeal of the institute of the government and law of the russian academy of sciences to president elchibey was received. the appeal contains the call ""to display mercy, humanism and clemency  on the death sentences of the former servicemen of the russian armed forces"".    the authors of the appeal point out, that they don't justify the participation of the russian servicemen in the war against the azeri people, don't call in question the lawfulness of the passed sentence, denounce the mercenary according to the un principals, and they are sorry about the russian servicemen being drawn in such grave crime.     at the end of their letter, scientists, mentioning the soldiers' mothers' tears and grief, their praying day and night of safety, ask the president of azerbaijan to ""save those guys"".    it should be noticed, that unlike lawyers, soldiers' mothers, taking part in the inquiry, called the cause of their grief only russian policy. according to their words, the leaders, that lay down lives of russian men to achieve their political aims, must be made answerable.     unfortunately, the appeal didn't mention the grief of the mothers of azerbaijani soldiers, killed by sentenced russian servicemen.--0--   armenian artillery continues firing on azeri districts       baku (may 22) turan: on may 22, two soldiers of national army of azerbaijan were killed during the ""grad"" shelling of the villages of kolly gyshlag, shaifly, shotaraz, nyachaflar of zangelan district of the republic from the territory of kafan district of armenia.      the night before and in the morning of may 22, the villages of tovuz, gazakh and gubatly districts of azerbaijan were under fire from the territory of armenia. there are destructions.       the situation in agder district of azerbaijan became complicated.  on may 21, the enemy fired on the regional centre of agdere from the village of ortakend. the transportation of man power and military equipment to this district is in progress. according to reports the enemy is setting up a new weapon emplacement to fire on the regional centre and near by villages.      according to the ministry of internal affairs, the concentration of man power and military equipment is observed in krasnoselsky district of armenia which borders on azerbaijan as well as on the frontier with fizuli district. --o--   azeri prime-minister is leaving for great britain    baku ( may 22 ) turan : the minister of foreign economic relations, rauf garayev, in his interview to turan agency said, that ""great britain is the biggest foreign economic partner of azerbaijan after iran"". the business cooperation between the two countries develops in such spheres as oil - industry, the manufacture of oil extraction equipment, communication and agriculture.   according to the minister's words, the forthcoming visit of azerbaijani prime-minister, panah huseynov, to great britain on may 23-24, is very important. it is expected, that the visit will help, to solve the problems of opening in azerbaijan the branch offices of some british banks, insurance firms; to conclude contracts on the sphere of manufacture of agricultural equipment; on building in azerbaijan off shore oil platforms, and reconstruction of the entire communication system of azerbaijan.    in garayev's view, the expansion of the cooperation with great britain will have a great political meaning for azerbaijan.    according to politicians and reviewers in baku, at present, great britain as an european state is close to azerbaijan. the continuation of the economic and political cooperation of the two states is foreseen. --o--             \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

"----- begin included message -----  the following teaching is brought to you on behalf of malcolm smith ministries, a ministry dedicated to leading believers everywhere into a knowledge of the love of god.  if you would like more info on the ministry, and/or would like to comment on whether you found this teaching beneficial, e-mail to randy hunt at rlhunt@hou.amoco.com.   love in the morning  (psalm 90:14)  by malcolm smith  moses wrote this prayer at a weary time in the history of israel. a generation before the time of its writing, the people of israel had stood at kadesh, gateway to canaan, and made the fateful choice to go their own way rather than god's way. they refused an adventure of faith in god which would have given them canaan, the homeland of promise. god honored their decision, and said they would wander in the desert only a few miles from the land of promise until they were all buried in the sand. the young decision- makers of that fateful day were between twenty and thirty years old, and destined to be dead within forty years... bleached bones in the desert by the time they were seventy-- eighty, at the most. the lives of these wanderers had been unending sadness. moses described it as ending each year with a sigh (v. 9). the fact that they knew, give or take a few months, when they were going to die, underscored the meaninglessness of their existence. whatever heights of success they reached, they would be a heap of bleached bones within forty years.  the only ones to live outside of that depression of hopeless disbelief were joshua and caleb, who had stood against the nation at kadesh and had god' s promise of one day entering the land. the forty-year period was finally drawing to an end. the new generation, those who were children at kadesh, were now grown and eager to take the inheritance their parents had refused to enjoy. in the light of this, moses prays...it is time for a new day to begin and the days of misery to be over. all these years, as moses had walked with these moaning and complaining people through the wilderness of their exile, he had carried a double burden. his was not only the sadness of living in less than what could have been; but he also knew why they had chosen as they had at kadesh.  the problem was that they were ignorant of the character of their god. if asked. ""who is your god?"" they would have described him as the god who is power. when aaron had created their concept of god in an idol. he chose a calf. or young bull--a symbol of power, of virility. in their minds, god was the young bull who had impaled pharaoh on his horns and gored egypt's gods as he led israel to sinai.  but when man worships a god of power, his miracles grow thin and even boring. after miracle food on the desert floor and water gushing miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland, the god of almightiness becomes ""ho-hum --what' s next on the miracle menu?"" and a god of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull calf. he might be all they need, but then...who knows? if he has all power, he has a right to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants. the only person these people had known who had absolute power was pharaoh, and men's lives had hung on the whim of his moods, which could change with the wind. they believed god could work his wonders on their behalf, but they did not know him and, so, could not trust him. israel had a god based on what he did, his acts; moses knew the heart of god, the motivation behind the acts. from the day of his encounter at the burning bush, moses had been fascinated by god. at sinai, he asked to be shown his glory...to know who he really was. he had seen what god had done; he wanted to know who god was. this request was granted, and moses was given a glimpse of god's glorious person. he had come to know the heart of god as compassion and lovingkindness (exodus 34:6,7). the word ""lovingkindness"" is not to be understood as a human kind of love. it speaks of the kind of relationship arising out of the making of a covenant. it can only be understood as the love that says, ""i will never leave you nor forsake you."" lovingkindness is as tenacious as a british bulldog; when the world walks out, this love digs in its heels and refuses to leave.and it is not human romantic love, based on feelings and rooted in emotions. it is a love of covenant commitment and, therefore, operates quite apart from feelings. god's love is not an emotion that wavers day by day; it is the total commitment of his being to seek our highest and best, and to bring us to our fullest potential as humans. god does not see something good and beautiful in us which arouses his feelings of love toward us...we do not woo him and cause him to fall in love with us! if that were the case, the first ugly, sinful thing we did would cause him to reject us.  he is love, and he loves us because of who he is-- not because of who we are. he does not love what we do, but he is committed to us, pursuing us down every blind alley and bypath of foolishness. he will not let us go. his is a love that is not looking for what it can get out of us-- but a committed love that searches for opportunities to give to us. it is saying to the recipient, ""for as long as we shall live, i am for you.""  the god who has revealed himself to man through scripture and, finally, in jesus--in his coming, and in his death and resurrection--is the god who is lovingkindness. thus he loves us and gives himself to us...he will never leave us nor forsake us.  tragically, many believers have never seen him as love; they see him as power. no one will come to faith by just seeing miracles. miracles point to who he is, and that is when faith springs in the heart.  israel did not see god as lovingkindness; they saw his acts of power. moses knew his ways, the kind of god he was, and the love that he had for these people. because of their total lack of understanding of his love, they could not trust him to be their strength in taking the land. faith is born out of knowing the love he has for us; it is the resting response to the one who gives himself to us. he is not the force, and to call him the almighty is to miss his heart. he is love who is the almighty and the infinite force.  if man is to make force or raw power work for him, he must depend on knowing the forrnula and have faith in it. but the power that issues from love demands faith in the person of love himself. the forty years of meaningless wandering was a monument to a people who had never come to know the god of love.  at this point, with the new generation and the possibility of enjoying all that god promised, moses prays verse 14. the language moses uses is reminiscent of a baby having slept secure in its mother's love, now waking to look up into the delight of her eyes. it is waking to the consciousness of being loved... watched over, cared for, protected, fed, and cleaned, day and night, by the mother. suppose we were to ask, ""what has the baby done to deserve this?"" or, ""have arrangements been made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience?"" our questions would be considered unnatural, even immoral. the child was conceived in love, anticipated and prepared for with love's excitement, a love that has been to the gates of death to bring it into being. the parents' love is unconditional, spontaneous...it has nothing to do with the looks of the child or its performance. so god is love. he loves us unconditionally, spontaneously. we were conceived in his imagination and fashioned after his image, to be brought to where we are at this moment by the blood of the lord jesus. it is slanderous, and immoral, to even ask what we must do to earn and deserve that love. the child discovers its personhood and identity through the eyes and touch, through the cuddles, of its parents' love. it is a scientific fact that a baby who is not touched and held will probably die or, if it survives, will have severe emotional problems. and a person who has been held and loved will still never know the true meaning of life without the embrace and knowledge of love from god. moses prays that the new generation will learn to wake every morning, resting with total confidence in the love of god. and will receive all his promises and blessings with joy and gladness. significantly, moses prays that they will be satisfied with his love. ""satisfied."" in the hebrew language. is a rich picture word describing being filled with an abundance of gourmet food. it is also used to describe the earth after the rain has soaked it and all the vegetation has received enough water. moses prays that they will awaken every morning to be drenched in the life-giving love of god. that sense of satisfaction is the lifelong quest of every man and woman. when we are satisfied in our deepest selves, many of our emotional--and even our physical--problems disappear. man seeks that sense of satisfaction which comes from feeling that he is fulfilled as a human being...his hours have meaning, which make sense out of the ordinary and mundane. apart from god, man seeks this satisfaction through intellectual pursuit, through the exciting of the emotions, and through the feeding of his body...he will even seek it in religious exercise. but man will always be dissatisfied until he is responding to the love of the living god. only in knowing god's love will the rest of life make sense. as the forty years drew to a close and the land of promise again became the inheritance to be taken, moses prayed this psalm. i find it fascinating that he  should pray and ask god for a daily revelation of his love. considering the awe with which the people held moses. one would think he could have lectured them on the subject of lovingkindness and, by the knowledge they gained, they would live in it. but moses knew better. god is the only one who can make known to us his love. we won't find it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use to manipulate him. nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions and give us god feelings. it is god, himself, the lover, who must open our eyes and satisfy us with his love. this prayer is man, in helplessness, asking god to make the love he is real in our hearts. moses' prayer was partially answered in the next generation and seen in the exploits of faith which worked by love in the book of judges. but it would not be answered in its fullest dimensions until the coming of the holy spirit, who pours out the love of god in our hearts (romans 5:5). in the history of the early church, we read of the holy spirit ""falling upon"" the believers. this is an ancient expression that, in modern english, means to give a bear hug. it is used in luke 15 to describe the father running to the prodigal and ""falling on his neck and kissing him."" the holy spirit is god hugging you in your deepest self and smothering you with divine kisses at the deepest level of your being. this is not a one-time experience to be filed in our spiritual resumes. moses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realization that we are loved. the world, and much of our religious training, has taught us to perform in order to be accepted. we have spent far too long living in a state of doing in order to find satisfaction for ourselves...to find acceptance and love from others, and from god. we now come humbled to receive love we cannot earn...to be still and let him tell us we are loved: to let the holy spirit descend into us, pouring out the love of god. we come in stillness to think on and repeat his words of love to our minds. which have been jaded with the doctrine of ""perform to be accepted."" we begin to realize that he loves us as we are, and gives meaning and purpose to all of life. i challenge everyone reading this to begin each day, from the moment you open your eyes, by celebrating the god of love and praying this prayer. you may not feel anything, but something always happens. i was x-rayed the other day. i did not see or feel anything, but i noted that the technicians kept behind protective walls. they know you cannot be exposed to those rays without being affected. so it is as we consciously begin our day knowing that we are loved. such experiential knowledge will produce, according to moses, ""joy and gladness all our days."" joy is the result of a life that is functioning as god intended us to function when he made us. you might say that joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak performance. man' s highest performance is to rest in the love god has for him... the hum will be joy, and the result will be endless creativity arising from the sense of meaning he now has in life. stop wandering in the wilderness. be satisfied with his love and, in joy, day by day, receive all his promised blessings.",15,soc.religion.christian

"why do we follow god so blindly?  have you ever asked a physically blind person why he or she follows a seeing eye dog? the answer is quite simple--the dog can see, and the blind person cannot.  	i acknowledge, as a christian, that i am blind.  i see, but i see  illusions as well as reality.  (watched tv lately?) i hear, but i hear lies as well as truth.  (listen to your  radio or read a newspaper.)  remember, all that tastes well is not healthy.  so, i rely one the one who can see, hear, and taste everything, and knows what is real, and what is not. that is god.  	of course, you may ask, if i cannot trust my own senses, how do i know whether what i see and hear about god is truth or a lie.  that is why we need faith to be saved.  we must force ourselves to believe that god knows the truth, and loves us enough to share it with us, even when it defies what we think we know.  why would he have created us if he did not love us  enough to help us through this world?  	i also do trust my experiences to some extent.  when i do things that defy the seeming logic of my experience,  because it is what my father commands me to do, and i see the results in the long term, i find that he has led me in the proper direction, even though it did not feel right at the time.  this is where our works as christians are important:  as exercises of the body make the body strong, excercises of faith make the faith strong.    	as for you, no one can ""convert"" you.  you must choose to follow god of your own will, if you are ever to follow him.  all we as christians wish to do is share with you the love we have received from god.  if you reject that, we have to accept your decision, although we always keep the offer open to you.  if you really want to find out why we believe what we believe, i can only suggest you try praying for faith, reading the bible, and asking christians about their experiences personally.  then you may grow to understand why we believe what we do, in defiance of the logic of this world.  	may the lord bring peace to you,",15,soc.religion.christian

"[...]  aw, c'mon.  the serious overreaction ought to be worth a couple of points, not to mention the bit condemning everthing the flamee might ever say. the non sequitur about guns and helmets is just the proper flourish.  i personally am of the opinion that there are two types of good flames. the first does trade ``quality,'' in the sense you mention, for heat. this has a certain surprise value and if done correctly, which i contend was done above, is reasonably entertaining.  while it is true that the flame i posted does not mention anyone's habitual velocity, friends, dinner, or entertainment, it says what it needs to with the appropriate flair and it is short.  the weakness of this type of flame is actually that it can easily be taken too far, at which point it becomes trite and boring.  (witness the infante thread recently....)  the other type of flame, which you seem to be glorifying above, has a few weaknesses as well.  in the first place, it can get verbose and  tedious in the extreme, particularly if the reader does not already strongly identify with one side or the other.  in the second, discussing someone's personal qualities, habits, and so forth can quickly become libelous. (or is that slanderous?  i can never remember the difference.)  this leads to a proliferation of lawyers, which is widely regarded as a bad thing. finally, introducing polysyllabic words is problematic.  i can't haul my big dic. around on my bike, and it would be bad form to use a word which actually turned out to have a meaning, especially one which ran counter to my use and flamage in general.  in summary, blaine, your score for that flame is incorrect.  while it may be the wunder-flame, the weaknesses you point out are not necessarily weaknesses, and your suggested corrections are not always useful nor applicable.  you also probably couldn't outrun a tennis ball with a flatulent dog stapled to your posterior, and i'll bet you and your  motorcycle lean to the outside while turning.  the same goes for anyone who looks like you, too.   ----- tommy mcguire mcguire@cs.utexas.edu mcguire@austin.ibm.com",8,rec.motorcycles

"from: center for policy research <cpr> subject: hebrew labor: racist connotations   avoda ivrit - hebrew labor ---------------------------------  ""hebrew labor"" is a concept which has served the zionist movement for a long time.  it has a double-barreled message: 1) the new jew must learn to do physical labor, i.e. working the land; 2) the land in this country must pass into jewish hands, i.e. to the same new jew who has ""learned"" to work it. both aspects of the two-pronged concept of ""hebrew labor"" have racist connotations. on the one hand, the diaspora jew's lack of training in physical labor is a myth shared by zionists and antisemites.  on the other hand, its meaning in practice has been the displacement of the arab farmer from the source of his livelihood.  the occupation and the cheap palestinian labor which streamed from the occupied territories to the factories, orchards, and hot-houses of israel relegated the myth of ""hebrew labor"" to the history books and nostalgic memories of the zionist movement. it has blossomed forth anew, however, as the government's answer to problems caused by the closure of the territories. today too this concept has two functions: 1) to give a progressive look to the closing of the palestinian population.  or in the words of environment minister yossi sarid, ""i have no tears for those who get rich off of cheap labor"". 2) to furnish an answer to the unemployed israeli who complains of being obliged to work for wages that are lower than the unemployment insurance he receives.",17,talk.politics.mideast

"one not-so-quick question to throw out there for you guys...  for our class project, we need to design and build a power supply to the following specs:  voltatge:  adjustable from 1-12v current:   *limited* at 1a  voltage must stay within 2% of designated value for i from 0-1a ac ripple less than 5 mv (rms)  of course, we can't just use an adjustable voltage, current-limiting regulator chip ;^)  our problem is with the current limiting (i.e. we've found stuff to do the rest of the parts of the circuit).  what the supply must do, if presented with a load which would draw more than 1a, given the supply voltage, is reduce the voltage so that the current will equal one amp.  thus, if we were to short the thing with the ammeter, we should read one amp.  if we measure the current through a 1 ohm  resistor at 12v, we should read one amp (and the output voltage, by necessity, must be 1v.  the only basic idea we have seen for the current limiter involves a circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output  power transistor, and therefore reduce the output.  so, does anybody have any ideas we could work from?  thanks in advance.  andy collins, kc6yey acollins@uclink.berkeley.edu",12,sci.electronics

  : wouldst thou prefer if i were to communicate with thou in bilespeak?) :  : does an arachnophobe have an irrational fear of being a spider?  does an : agoraphobe have an irrational fear of being a wide open space?  do you : understand english? :  : obviously someone who has  phobia will react to it.  they will do their best : to avoid it and if that is not possible they will either strike out or : run away.  or do gaybashings occur because of natural processes?  people : who definately have homophobia will either run away from gay people or : cause them (or themselves) violence. :   isn't that what i said ... what are you taking issue with here, your remarks are merely parenthetical to mine and add nothing useful.  : [...] :  : |> it would seem odd if homosexuality had any evolutionary function : |> (other than limiting population growth) since evolution only occurs : |> when the members of one generation pass along their traits to : |> subsequent generations. homosexuality is an evolutionary deadend. if i : |> take your usage of the term, homophobe, in the sense you seem to : |> intend, then all men are really homosexual and evolution of our : |> species at least, is going nowhere. : |>  :  : so *every* time a man has sex with a woman they intend to produce children? : hmm...no wonder the world is overpopulated.  obviously you keep to the : monty python song:  ""every sperm is sacred"".  and if, as *you* say, it has : a purpose as a means to limit population growth then it is, by your own  : arguement, natural.  consider the context, i'm talking about an evolutionary function. one of the most basic requirements of evolution is that members of a species procreate, those who don't have no purpose in that context.  :  : |> another point is that if the offspring of each generation is to : |> survive, the participation of both parents is necessary - a family must : |> exist, since homosexuals do not reproduce, they cannot constitute a : |> family. since the majority of humankind is part of a family, : |> homosexuality is an evolutionary abberation, contrary to nature if you : |> will. : |>  :  : well if that is true, by your own arguements homosexuals would have  : vanished *years* ago due to non-procreation.  also the parent from single : parent families should put the babies out in the cold now, cos they must, : by your arguement, die.  by your argument, homosexuality is genetically determined. as to your second point, you prove again that you have no idea what context means. i am talking about evolution, the preservation of the species, the fundamental premise of the whole process. :  : |> but it gets worse. since the overwhelming majority of people actually : |> -prefer- a heterosexual relationship, homosexuality is a social : |> abberation as well. the homosexual eschews the biological imperative : |> to reproduce and then the social imperative to form and participate in : |> the most fundamental social element, the family. but wait, there's : |> more. : |>  :  : read the above.  i expect you to have at least ten children by now, with : the family growing.  these days sex is less to do with procreation (admittedly : without it there would be no-one) but more to do with pleasure.  in pre-pill : and pre-condom days, if you had sex there was the chance of producing children. : these days is just ain't true!  people can decide whether or not to have  : children and when.  soon they will be able to choose it's sex &c (but that's  : another arguement...) so it's more of a ""lifestyle"" decision.  again by : your arguement, since homosexuals can not (or choose not) to reproduce they must : be akin to people who decide to have sex but not children.  both are  : as ""unnatural"" as each other.  yet another non-sequitur. sex is an evolutionary function that exists for procreation, that it is also recreation is incidental. that homosexuals don't procreate means that sex is -only- recreation and nothing more; they serve no -evolutionary- purpose.  :  : |> since homosexuals have come out the closet and have convinced some : |> policy makers that they have civil rights, they are now claiming that : |> their sexuality is a preference, a life-style, an orientation, a : |> choice that should be protected by law. now if homosexuality is a mere : |> choice and if it is both contrary to nature and anti-social, then it : |> is a perverse choice; they have even less credibility than before they : |> became prominent.  : |>  :  : people are people are people.  who are you to tell anyone else how to live : their life?  are you god(tm)?  if so, fancy a date?  here's pretty obvious dodge, do you really think you've said anything or do you just feel obligated to respond to every statement? i am not telling anyone anything, i am demonstrating that there are arguments against the practice of homosexuality (providing it's a merely an alternate lifestlye) that are not homophobic, that one can reasonably call it perverse in a context even a atheist can understand. i realize of course that this comes dangerously close to establishing  a value, and that atheists are compelled to object on that basis, but if you are to be consistent, you have no case in this regard. :  : |> to characterize any opposition to homosexuality as homophobic is to : |> ignore some very compelling arguments against the legitimization of : |> the homosexual ""life-style"". but since the charge is only intended to : |> intimidate, it's really just demogoguery and not to be taken : |> seriously. fact is, jim, there are far more persuasive arguments for : |> suppressing homosexuality than those given, but consider this a start. : |>  :  : again crap.  all your arguments are based on outdated ideals.  likewise the : bible.  would any honest christian condemn the ten generations spawned by : a ""bastard"" to eternal damnation?  or someone who crushes his penis (either : accidently or not..!).  both are in deuteronomy.  i'm sure your comment pertains to something, but you've disguised it so well i can't see what. where did i mention ideals, out-dated or otherwise? your arguments are very reactionary; do you have anything at all to contribute?  :  : |> as to why homosexuals should be excluded from participation in : |> scouting, the reasons are the same as those used to restrict them from : |> teaching; by their own logic, homosexuals are deviates, social and : |> biological. since any adult is a role model for a child, it is : |> incumbent on the parent to ensure that the child be isolated from : |> those who would do the child harm. in this case, harm means primarily : |> social, though that could be extended easily enough. : |>  : |>  :  : you show me *anyone* who has sex in a way that everyone would describe as : normal, and will take of my hat (puma baseball cap) to you.

"# i hope i gave you a fairly solid answer to this one: i simply don't agree # with the embodied version of a satan who is a separate creation or a force.    # and there are quite physical descriptions of heaven and hell in the # holy qur'an, the bible, etc.  there have been times in the spiritual # and intellectual evolution of the modern human when these physical # descriptions of heaven, hell, and satan were taken quite literally # and that *worked* for the time.  as i mentioned in the tradition # cited above, for example, it was sufficient in the absence of a theory # about germs and disease spread by worms to simply describe the ""evil"" # which was passed to a consumer of spoiled food as ""satanic.""       which begs the question: if satan in this case is      metaphorical, how can you be certain allah is not      the same way?  # the bottom line here, however, is that describing a spiritual plane # in human language is something like describing ""color"" to a person # who has been blind from birth.  you may want to read the book # flatland (if you haven't already) or the dragon's egg.  the first # is intended as a light hearted description of a mathematical con- # cept...  [some deleted for space saving]  # when language fails because it cannot be used to adequately describe # another dimension which cannot be experienced by the speakers, then # such conventions as metaphor, allegory, and the like come to be # necessary.  the ""unseen"" is described in terms which have reference` # and meaning for the reader/listener.  but, like all models, a compro- # mise must be made when speaking metaphorically: clarity and directness # of meaning, equivalence of perception, and the like are all # crippled.  but what else can you do?       this is why i asked the above.  how would you then      know god exists as a spirit or being rather than      just being metaphorical?  i mean, it's okay to say      ""well, satan is just metaphorical,"" but then you      have to justify this belief and justify that god is      not some metaphor for something else.       i say this because there are many, many instances of      satan described as a being (such as the tormentor in       the old testament book of job, or the temptor in the      new testament gospels).  in the same way, god too is      described as a being (or spirit.)  how am i to know      one is metaphorical and not the other.       further, belief in god isn't a bar to evil.  let's      consider the case of satanists: even if satan were      metaphorical, the satanist would have to believe      in god to justify this belief.  again, we have a       case where someone does believe in god, but by      religious standards, they are ""evil.""  if bobby      does see this, let him address this question also.

"here you give positive, accurate ""facts"" about what happened to the beduins and the land:     after the creation of the state of israel, 80 percent of the negev    bedouin were expelled to the sinai or to southern jordan. the    10,000 who were allowed to remain were confined to a territory of    40,000 hectares in a region were annual mean precipiation was 150    mm - a quantity low enough to ensure a crop failure two years out    of three. the rare water wells in the south and central negev,    spring of life in the desert, were cemented to prevent bedouin    shepherds from roaming.     a few bedouin shepherds were allowed to stay in the central negev.    but after 1982, when the sinai was returned to egypt, these    bedouin were also eliminated. at the same time, strong pressure    was applied on the bedouin to abandon cultivation of their fields    in order that the land could be transferred to the army.  and now you say noone knows anything about what happened there:     no reliable statistics exist concerning the amount of land held    today by negev bedouin. it is a known fact that a large part of    the 40,000 hectares they cultivated in the 1950s has been seized    by the israeli authorities. indeed, most of the bedouin are now    confined to seven ""development towns"", or *sowetos*, established    for them.     (the rest of the article is available from elias davidsson, email:    elias@ismennt.is)  so what you basically say is that ""we know for sure that nothing good happens there now,  we know for sure that the beduins prospered before the jews arrived and that they were driven away by the jews,  noone on earth knows about what the jews did there.""  is that what you said?  could you proove any of the nonsense you wrote?  btw,  try asking beduins in sinai how they mis the israelis.  not to mention that there are enough valotaring beduins in the idf to have at least one full brigade of them.",17,talk.politics.mideast

(i have also minor ideas for 24bit xv, e-mail me for them.)  any misundertanding of mine is understandable.   juhana kouhia   ==clip==  [ ..deleted..]  note that 'xv' saves only 8bit/rasterized images; that means that the saved jpegs are just like jpeg-to-gif-to-jpeg quality. also, there's three kind of 8bit quantizers; your final image quality depends on them too.   this were the situation when i read jpeg faq a while ago.   imho, it is design error of 'xv'; there should not be such confusing errors in programs. there's two errors:   -xv allows the saving of 8bit/rasterized image as jpeg even the    original is 24bit -- saving 8bit/rasterized image instead of    original 24bit should be a special case   -xv allows saving the 8bit/rasterized image made with any quantizer    -- the main case should be that 'xv' quantizes the image with the    best quantizer available before saving the image to a file; lousier    quantizers should be just for viewing purposes (and a special cases    in saving the image, if at all)   ==clip==  ==clip==  [ ..deleted..]  it is limit of *xv*, but not limit of design. it is error in design. it is error that 8bit/quantized/rasterized images are stored as jpegs; jpeg is not designed to that.  as matter of fact, i'm sure when xv were designed 24bit displays were known. it is not bad error to program a program for 8bit images only at that time, but when 24bit image formats are included to program the whole design should be changed to support 24bit images. that were not done and now we have  -the program violate jpeg design (and any 24bit image format)  -the program has human interface errors.  otherway is to drop saving images as jpegs or any 24bit format without clearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal use.  [ ..deleted.. ]  ==clip==  some new items follows.  ==clip==  i have seen that xv quantizes the image sometimes poorly with -best24 option than with default option we have. the reason surely is the quantizer used as -best24; it is (surprise) the same than used in ppmquant.  if you remember, i have tested some quantizers. in that test i found that rlequant (with default) is best, then comes djpeg, fbmquant, xv (our default) in that order. in my test ppmquant suggeeded very poorly -- it actually gave image with bad artifacts.  i don't know is ppmquant improved any, but i expect no. so, use of xv's -best24 option is not very good idea.  i suggest that author of xv changes the quantizer to the one used in rlequant -- i'm sure rle-people gives permission. (another could be one used in imagemagick; i have not tested it, so i can say nothing about it.)  ==clip==  ==clip==  some minor bugs in human interface are:  key pressings and cursor clicks goes to a buffer; often it happens that i make click errors or press keyboard when cursor is in the wrong place. it is very annoying when you have waited image to come about five minutes and then it is gone away immediately. the buffer should be cleaned when the image is complete.  also, good idea is to wait few seconds before activating keyboard and mouse for xv after the image is completed. often it happens that image pops to the screen quickly, just when i'm writing something with editor or such. those key pressings then go to xv and image has gone or something weird.  in the color editor, when i turn a color meter and release it, xv updates the images. it is impossible to change all rgb values first and then get the updated image. it is annoying wait image to be updated when the setting are not ready yet. i suggest of adding an 'apply' button to update the exchanges done.",1,comp.graphics
"excellently put!  even as a libertarian, i have to admit government does do some things i like.  there is a beautiful performing arts complex in ft.  lauderdale that was partially built with tax dollars (i don't know how much was private and how much was stolen, i mean public) but it is beautiful and i enjoy it.  (keep in mind, though, most of the people in the city will never attend a single performance there, so they might feel differently about having to help pay for it.)  however, i have to disagree about it being desireable or efficient to give government intervention-power on a case-by-case basis.  in fact, we have a lot better luck maintaining our freedom of speech precisely because it is not decided on a case-by-case basis as much as other issues.  judges decide whether political speech is allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office.  they do not try to decide just whether pro-nazi, pro-choice, pro-life, or pro-tax political speech should be allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office.  you can imagine the result if right to free speech was decided by the majority on a case-by-case basis.  not so with economic issues.  government does tell taxi-drivers exactly what they can charge, but not the bus lines or the lawyers.  just as it is not desireable to decide rights of free speech on a case-by-case basis, we should not decide rights to free enterprise on a case-by-case basis.  there is hope that a government can be restricted from interferring with free enterprise.  but there is no hope, in my opinion, of having a government that interferes with free enterprise in an ""efficient"" manner; i call it political market failure.  thus, if you value freedom and the abundance it produces, you have to swallow the ""whole libertarian agenda.""",18,talk.politics.misc

"perhaps you're using the wrong brand! (sorry all hp fans, but i have a hard time being convinced that their scopes match the rest of their (excellent) gear).  one of the principal functions i look for when considering a dso is whether you can turn interpolation off. the other important feature is to disable repetitive waveform acquisition i.e. being able to lock the instrument into real time capture mode.   i agree with you here. the only consolation is that manufacturers are _beginning_ to pay attention to ergonomics when designing the menus. however, to be fair, it seems that first time scope users (our students) seem to adjust to menus easier than navigating around the twenty or more knobs required of a ""real"" scope :-)   this is one area that newer dsos are addressing. i recently evaluated the latest box from tek - their tds320 - which seems to be a worthy alternative to a standard 100mhz analogue cro. this instrument has a 100mhz, 500ms/s spec, meaning that it is _always_ in real time capture mode. the pricing also matches equivalent analogue scopes in the range. the downer is that the instrument uses menus again, but at least they appear to be logically laid out.  one more thing about the new, ""simpler"", front panels. these instruments tend to use digital rotary encoders as knobs now. this is a vast improvement over the old oak switch. the single most common cause of failure in our scopes (other than students blowing up inputs!) is mechanical wear on these switches. i look at the new panels as a great step toward increasing the longevity of the instruments.  johnh  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------        |  _  |_   _   |_|  _   _|  _|              electronics department     |_| (_) | | | |  | | (_| (_| (_| \/           school of mpce     ---------------------------------/-           macquarie university                                                   sydney, australia 2109      email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, ph: +61 2 805 8959, fax: +61 2 805 8983",12,sci.electronics

"i was having a look through a couple of components catalogues when i came across a range of peltier effect heat pumps intended for cooling components.  for those who have not heard of this effect, you put a current through one of these devices, and it pumps heat from one side to the other.  reverse the current and you reverse the effect.  i think a temperature difference can give you an emf as well.  anyway, it struck me that you could make a nice cool/hot box for picnics with one of these, a power regulator, a thermostat and a couple of heat sinks.  the biggest device can shift 60w with an efficiency of 80-90%, which ain't bad (although it would flatten my car battery in about half an hour).  unfortunately the catalogue didn't list anything more than the basic specs as a heat pump.  i imagine that you would get a back-emf as the temperature gradient across the device increases.  if so, presumably its power decreases as the back-emf increases, until eventually we have a steady state with no current being consumed (assuming no leakage).  if so, then the final temperature difference between the two sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more (although that would be a lousy way to control it).  what i would like to know is:  1: are the above guesses correct?  2: what is the open-circuit thermal resistance of a typical device?    (i just want to be sure that my coolbox is not going to get warm    too fast when i unplug it)  3: how does a peltier effect heat pump actually work?  it looks like    magic!  4: why don't they use these things in domestic fridges/freezers?   thanks in advance,  paul.",12,sci.electronics

(john 3:6)  clearly infants are not born of the spirit.  thus, without baptism they are unspiritual.  they are not born with the image of god, but in adam's fallen image (cf. gen 5:3).  they have no righteousness of their own, just as adults have no righteousness of their own.  there is only the imputed righteousness of christ, which believers receive through faith.  alan> 3.  we can ask ourselves why the lord would even introduce the alan> concept of spiritual re-birth through baptism if newborn babies alan> weren't free from sin?  your point is a little obscure here, but i think you are saying that christ used the ""innocence"" of newborn babes as a metaphor for spiritual re-birth.  but this is not what he did. if you look at the text, he did not speak of spiritual re-birth but of spiritual birth.  we are born of the spirit once, not twice or several times. we are also born of the flesh once.  the lord makes it clear that these are separate and different events. it is true that other scriptures refer to spiritual birth as re-birth because it is a second birth (for example, titus 3:5).  but it is not a second *spiritual* birth.  the only thing the two births have in common is the concept of birth, which is used as a symbol of `new life' -- not of innocence.  when an infant is born (or conceived) a new life is begun--but it is neither innocent nor righteous.  similarly when that same individual is baptized, or perhaps when they believe prior to baptism, they begin a new life in christ (romans 6:3, colossians 2:12, titus 3:5, ephesians 2:5).  then the believer has god's assurance of the forgiveness of their sins, and of christ's imputed righteousness.  for references, see  	the augsburg confession article ii, original sin,  	the apology to the augsburg confession,  		article ii, original sin,  	the formula of concord, article i, original sin, and  	luther's large catechism, part 4, baptism.    for something more recent, see ""baptized into god's family: the doctrine of infant baptism"" by andrew das, available from northwestern publishing house.  andrew is a graduate of concordia lutheran seminary, st. louis, and is now pursuing doctoral studies at yale divinity school.",15,soc.religion.christian

"the problem you see here is that some christians claim things about the bible which they don't actually believe or practice. i've known all sorts of christians, ranging from the trendiest of liberals to the fire-breathing fundamentalists, and although many on the  conservative side of the christian faith do claim that the bible is a (perhaps *the*) source of absolute truth, i don't know of anyone who treats it as anything other than a valuable part of a living tradition. while i am not a roman catholic, i believe this is close to the official position of the rc church (perhaps an rc would like to comment).  the particular practice you refer to will usually be explained in terms of the social context of the time. you would think the fact  that the conservatives seem to have to break out the tophat-and-cane  and give you some big song-and-dance routine about why this  (other passages as well) aren't directly applicable today would  show them that what they claim about the bible and what they  actually practice are two different things, but mostly it doens't.  while this thread is supposed to be about the arrogance of christians, i would suggest that some of the problem is really hypocrasy, in this case, making claims about the bible which the claimants don't actually put into practice. but if we step back from the name-calling and look at what people are attempting to say, we see that they are trying to express very concisely the unique place the bible holds within the christian faith. so when people use such words or phrases as ""word of god"", ""inerrant"", ""infallibale"", ""the manufacturer's handbook"", ""the only rule of faith and practice in the church today"" to describe the bible, we should try to hear what they are saying and not just look at the mere words they use. some of the above descriptions are demostratably false and others are self-contradictory, but in my experience people are generally pretty good at picking out the intention of the speaker even when the speaker's words are at variance with their intentions. a biblical example is from the garden of eden where god asks ""where are you?"" and adam explains that he was naked and afraid and hid himself. if adam had answered god's words he would have said something like ""i'm here in this tree."" the problem seems to arise when christians insist that these words are indeed accurate reflections of their beleif. most people have not made a determined effort to work out their own understanding of the place of the bible within their own faith and so rely on the phrases and explanations that others use.  i hope this helps. --                                                                      ___ bill rea                                                            (o o) -------------------------------------------------------------------w--u--w---",15,soc.religion.christian

"(reference line trimmed)    well, i'd say that a murderer is one who intentionally committed a murder. for instance, if you put a bullet into a gun that was thought to contain blanks, and someone was killed with such a gun, the person who actually performed the action isn't the murderer (but i guess this is actually made clear in the below definition).   what do you mean by ""reasonable?""  [...]  yes, it is bad to include the word being defined in the definition.  but, even though the series is recursively infinite, i think the meaning can still be deduced.   [math lesson deleted]  okay, let's look at this situation:  suppose there is a longstanding feud between two families which claim that the other committed some travesty in the distant past.  each time a member of the one family kills a member of the other, the other family thinks that it is justified in killing a that member of the first family.  now, let's suppose that this sequence has occurred an infinite number of times.  or, if you don't like dealing with infinities, suppose that one member of the family goes back into time and essentially begins the whole thing.  that is, there is a never-ending loop of slayings based on some non-existent travesty. how do you resolve this?  well, they are all murders.  now, i suppose that this isn't totally applicable to your ""problem,"" but it still is possible to reduce an uninduced system.  and, in any case, the nested ""murderer"" in the definition of murder cannot be infintely recursive, given the finite existence of humanity. and, a murder cannot be committed without a killing involved.  so, the first person to intentionally cause someone to get killed is necessarily a murderer.  is this enough of an induction to solve the apparently unreducable definition?  see, in a totally objective system where all the information is available, such a nested definition isn't really a problem.",0,alt.atheism

"i've got two lines coming into my apartment. two different telephone numbers. when i ordered the second line installed, instead of bringing out another 4 wire bundle, the telco just connected up to my yellow and black wires. so i have one line on red & green and the other on yellow & black.  today i was monitoring the voltage on both lines. i had a voltmeter across the red and green and read back 52 volts. i then lifted up the receiver on my second line.(black & yellow wires) the voltage dropped to 31 volts on the first line. (red & green wires) i repeated this experiment with the second line(monitoring black & yellow and lifting the handset off the cradle on the red and green line.) it also dropped to 31 volts.   why is this ? i thought these were separate lines.  next i went to the 66 block and disconnected the blue and white lines coming in from the telco cable. i then disconnected all the phones in my apartment and went back to the 66 block and did some resistance measurements. both lines read open.  i'll appreciate any help on this. is this considered normal ?  guy urbina",12,sci.electronics

"hmm, followup on my own posting... well, who cares.  first let me try to work out the facts that we get to know about the clipper-chip, from what hellman and denning were able to tell us:  the chip itself is not confined to (digital) telephony, but performs general encryption in a symmetric manner.  the chip supports cfb ofb ecb (and whatever the fourth mode of operation for des is), the algorithm consists of 32 rounds of *whatever*, and takes 80-bit keys. input data seems to be 64 bit? yes. so if two people want secure communication (whatever that means when  clipper is involved) they have first to agree on one secret key.  (or is it one key per direction ?) they can exchange this key via dh-schemes or however. somehow the two feed their so won secret key into the clipper-chip which is now ready to work. the clipper chip carries an unique serial-number (30 bit's), and 160 key-bits. these 160 key-bits seem to have been gained by encrypting the serial-number with 160 seed-bits. (the seed-bits seem not to be stored in the chip) at beginning of communication (and perhaps at certain invtervals whithin??) before sending the fist real 64-bit output of the first encryption the clipper chip put's out packets (i guess 3) which represent the serial number, and the session key. this might look like x{ e[k; chipkeyk1+k2], serial number} where x is a transformation of these 3? packets involving a family-key. this family(sp?)-key is equal for all chips. (x might be a simple xor ???) after that, the (digital?) phone-call can be done as usual, every packet being encrypted and decrypted by clipper.  denning describes how k1 and k2 shall be generated, using a seed of 160 bit's.  now, leaving alone politics, which does not concern me as much as you, not being an american citicien(tm) [ :-) ] , there are some weak points in this scheme, which might be exploited by several parties.  as far as i know about the generation of k1,k2 ; s1 and s2 look like the  obvious backdoor. they could be used to generate the chip-keys by knowing the serial-number (and also the family-key) of the chip. i really can't imagine why these seeds would be needed otherwise, as true random-sources for the generation of the k1,k2 can be bought for not to much money.  then, the escrows. each of them will get 80 bit of a 160-bit key. security could (as little as existant) be maximized by giving them 160-bits each, which have to be xored together to give the k1,k2. now let's simply assume the escrows are trustworthy, and can't be fooled by criminals or law enforchemnt agencies. (and there will be no quarrel between escrows and l.e.a which would hinder the l.e.a in doing their duties, and so on and so on) once the keys are surrendered, the corresponding chip is compromised forever. not very clever, imho [ :-)) ]. how about sending in the encrypted session-keys for each phone-call that the police (or whoever) want's to listen to? escrows could then simply decode this session-key and send it back to police. (and would naturally not do this after the warrant has expired...) this would be a better technical solution, but i guess politics will not work that way.  apparently (as miss dennings stated) the only one performing actually decodes of intercepted messages shall be the fbi. great. so local guys can not inter- cept (understand) your traffic anymore. does this mean that the fbi monopolizes the right to do legal wiretaps ? (how is law over there, i have no idea who is allowed to tap, and who not) this certainly means that watched communi- cations will be routed automatically from the service-providing company to the fbi, if the communicaiton is a watched one. and this means as far as i understand it that the family-key has to be known by each switching- company, and those providing cellular-phone servies etcetc. so the family-key will not be very secret, and thus serial-numbers of calls will be readable by anybody who cares. i _like_ traffic-analysis!  what do you guess, what happens, if you use the chip in ecb mode, and the first few packets of the chip are somehow lost or garbled? so the session key would not be actually broadcasted over the line? hmmm. shouldn't be so difficult to do *that* :^)  and now a last point, for the other side. after all i have read and heard about clipper (not the programming language for dbase, is it ? [:-)]) it seems to have many advantages, which shold not be overseen!   now an afterthought to your rights. please note that i have no idea what i am talking about!!!  from: grady@netcom.com (1016/2ef221)  if this text is actually in your bill of rights, who can overrule this ? but: 'freedom of speech' is not 'secrecy of speech'  maybe you need to extend your amendment #4  to cover information and communication too ?  i am not very sure in what position your government actually is *legally* when it tries to ban cryptography (and arms) amendment say you may have them, but not under what conditions. hmm, tricky situation :-(  actually it will make not much sense to discuss that topic in sci.crypt... discussion of technical details and vulnerabilites of the system are highly suggested and appreciated :-)  friendly greetings,  	germano caronni   disclaimer: everything in here is derived from things i heard and read from other persons, so everything could be wrong. all opinions and thoughts in here are mine, and subject to change without further notification. no warranty, neither implicit not explicit etc. etc. etc. ad nauseam.  p.s. please don't ask me about political opinions, as i might not bother to re-      ply.

"the above does not tell the proper story of scsi: scsi-i: 8-bit asynchronous {~1.5mb/s ave}, synchronous {5mb/s max} transfer  base. scsi-1{faster} this requires a scsi-2 controller chip and provides  scsi-2 {8-bit to 16-bit} speeds with scsi-1 controlers. scsi-2: 4-6mb/s with 10mb/s burst{8-bit}, 8-12mb/s with 20mb/s burst {16-bit},  and 15-20mb/s with 40mb/s burst{32-bit/wide and fast}.  16-bit scsi can be wide or fast, it depends on how the port is designed{the quadras will support fast scsi but not wide when the os scsi manager is rewritten since the quardas use a scsi-1 {non-wide} port}.  the article in pc mag 4/27/93:29 was talking about scsi-1 {scsi-2 uses ten (10) devices in it native mode, outside its native mode it behaves a lot like scsi-1 (7 devices, slower through put}  from your own figures scsi-1 is indeed twice esdi as the article pointed out as for ""20% faster then ide"" that seems to be 8-bit scsi-1 using a scsi-2  contoler chip {the mac quadra uses a scsi-2 controler chip for its scsi-1 and gets 6mb/s through put for asynchronous {8-bit} scsi-1, far in excess of a normal synchronous scsi-1 output} 120% of 8.3 is 9.96 which is near the burst of a scsi-1 machine with a scsi-2 controller chip.  the pc world seems to have scsi-1 and scsi-2 mixed up.  fact is scsi-2  controler chips allow near scsi-2 speeds through a scsi-1 device {as shown in the mac quadra} which skews some of the data of scsi-1 vs ide or esdi test. i agree that the article could have stated that the ""20% faster then ide"" came off a scsi-1 device with a scsi-2 chip.  maybe it was there and the editor killed it because the article was dealing with scsi-1 not scsi-2 and he did not understand the effect of a scsi-1 device with a scsi-2 controller chip. scsi-1 chips are limited to 5/mb max.  scsi-1 devices with scsi-2 chips {becoming common} produce up to 10mb/s in 8-bit mode and 20mb/s in 16-bit mode {the fast version, scsi-1 ports cannot use wide scsi}.  of cource the prime piece of wierdness is that scsi-1 devices have scsi-2 chips {or more accurately the machine does}. this allows the best of both worlds: high scsi-2 speeds and cheeper scsi-1 costs {full scsi-2 hardware (port, electronic controller, etc) is very expensive.  it also creates a logistic nightmare as to how fast scsi-1 goes.",3,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware
